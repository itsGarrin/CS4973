On March 30, 2016, Ruwe signed a book contract with the Oklahoma-based Tate Publishing and Enterprises, LCC for his novel \"Crown Jewels.\" The deal includes Ruwe\\'s future fiction and nonfiction works.\\n\\nWritings and Education\\nAs well as his radio and television journalism, Ruwe has written for newspapers and has authored books. Using research methods used in journalism, Ruwe has written three novels \"Dyeing of Colors\", \"Alluvial Reflections\", \"Pearly Gates\", and his fourth entitled \"Crown Jewels\" which is due to be published soon. His first novel \"Dyeing of Colors\" was published in 2003. His second novel, \"Alluvial Reflections\", published in 2004, is Ruwe\\'s attempt at thriller. In 2004, Ruwe went on Leave of Absence from Suffolk University to write his third novel \"Pearly Gates\", published in 2007. In the novel, the jury finds Fisha Bayu guilty and sends him to death row.  Ruwe\\'s latest novel \"Crown Jewels\" is a sequel in which Fisha Bayu seeks reparations for colonialism.\\n\\nRuwe holds a doctorate degree in Education from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. He was trained as a broadcaster by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and was educated at the New England Institute of Art and Communications, Suffolk University, Boston, Massachusetts, California State University, Fresno, Fresno Pacific University, Fresno, and Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts. He earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mass Communication and Journalism with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a Master\\'s Degree in History. He is a member of the Alpha Delta Pi Society and the Phi Alpha Theta an American honor society for undergraduate and graduates students and professors of history. At California State University, Fresno, he was conferred membership in Kappa Tau Alpha\\'s National Honor Society in Journalism and Mass Communication. In 2006, Ruwe became a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society an organisation that recognizes college students solely on the basis of their academic achievements. Well known honorary members include US President Bill Clinton, General Colin Powell, Astronaut John Glenn and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\\n\\nEarly life\\nRuwe was born in Wusakili Hospital, Kitwe, Zambia, the son of Jeremiah Aaron Ruwe and Rachel Mbizi. He attended Maiteneke Primary School in Chingola. In 1968, he was moved to Chingola Primary School an all-white school. In 1969 he attended high school at Chikola Secondary School, Chingola, and later at Matero Boys\\' Secondary School in Lusaka where he repeated form V. He was a member of the Chikola Debate Club and the Boys\\' Brigade. He sang in the Chiwempala Church Choir and the St. Marks Church Choir.\\n\\nCareer\\nIn 1975, he entered broadcasting as a Program Operator for Zambia Broadcasting Services, recording radio programs. The following year, Ruwe devised a television sketch show called Tiyende Pamodzi Comedy Show, based on the BBC format of The Two Ronnies, a comedy show aired on Television Zambia in the early seventies, featuring the double act of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett.\\n\\nRuwe\\'s first time to host a radio show was in 1977 when he took over the presentation of \"Sanyo Hit Parade\" from Humphrey Mapoma. Known by the listeners as \"Captain of the Air,\" Ruwe featured an eclectic selection of whatever sort of music struck his fancy. He began to get deluged with mail from listeners who asked him to play their favorite songs. So, Ruwe ventured into commercial radio production, getting sponsorship from various companies around the country.\\n\\nIn 1978, Ruwe resigned from ZBS and later moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where he produced a comedy show on the Voice of Kenya television entitled \"Come What May,\" featuring himself as the disastrous-prone \\'Dafurao.\\' The program was a sketch show crossed with a sitcom. It also included a duo of him and Rashpal Panesar reading a spoof of news. It is believed that Ruwe was the first to introduce locally produced English comedy on the Voice of Kenya. Ruwe also performed radio continuity duties, narrated various scripted programs and compiled/presented \"Jazz Hour\" on the Voice of Kenya.\\n\\nBBC Club\\nRuwe returned to Zambia in 1982. In the same year, he was sponsored by The British Council to study television production at the BBC Open University in Milton Keynes, England and became a member of the BBC Club.\\n\\nPrivate sector\\nUpon completion of the course, he returned home and in 1983 teamed up with Zambia\\'s prolific actress Mathilda Malamamfumu Tutu to form Rutu Advertising Agency. Their immediate hit was \"Secretary of the Year\" contest, which was launched in August 1984. The contest featured top-flight secretaries drawn from different parts of the country and drew interest from the private sector and parastatal organizations including the Bank of Zambia. In 1985, Ruwe and his partner acquired copies of the movie Love Brewed in an African Pot directed by Ghanaian film maker Akwa Ansah which they showed around the country. In the same year, Ruwe wrote his first book, Have A Good Laugh, a compilation of jokes from different parts of the world.\\n\\nIn 1986, Ruwe and Tutu split. Rutu became Rute Advertising (\\'te\\' drawn from his daughter Thembinkosi). Between 1986 and 1990 Ruwe scripted and hosted various radio and television programs which included \"Money Matters\" by the Bank of Zambia, \"The Road\" a production of the National Roads Board and the World Bank, \"Zamseed Radio Program\" by Zambia Seed Company, \"DBZ of the Air\" by the Development Bank of Zambia, and more than twenty companies under the auspices of INDECO group of companies. Television programs included \"The Tourist\" by Zambia National Tourist Board, and various sponsored musicals. During the first Zambia Annual Broadcasting Awards Ceremony, held in Lusaka on 29 December 1989, Ruwe was presented \"The Best Disc Jockey of the Year\" for all radio channels award, thereby being recognized as the best radio DJ in the country.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 1995, Ruwe operated his own car hire (Rute Car Hire) firm with a fleet of eleven cars and one bus. Ruwe was also known to feature at state functions, dinners and weddings as Master of Ceremonies (ringmaster), often bringing humor and fun to the occasion.\\n\\nCurrent life\\nIn 2006, Ruwe hosted a radio program called The World at Large, on Valley Public Radio, KVPR FM89.3 Fresno and KPRX FM89.1 Bakersfield, California. The program served as a vehicle to share ideas and possible solutions to the myriad of complex issues facing the world of trade. Between June and October 2006, Ruwe interviewed growers, food processors, manufacturers, importers and exporters. Program participants included corporate CEOs, members of Chamber and Commerce, Professors in Agricultural and Business schools, and US government officials in the trade departments.\\n\\nIn 2008, Ruwe, in league with distinguished scholars, Dr. Miles Ishigaki, professor at Fresno State, and Dr. Robert Marquez, scientist and affiliated New Mexico State University professor, created Africa Center (USA) a non-profit, all-inclusive clearinghouse for philanthropists, donors and sympathizers wishing to help African relief efforts and improve the lives of the displaced, impoverished and diseased in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\n2011- Ruwe is the author of \"Hunt for Successor Series\" based on Zambian politics. His article \"Hunt for Successor 8: Zambian Intellectuals are Lazy\" (retitled \\'You Lazy (Intellectual) African Scum!\\' ) went viral. He is the author of the \"Biography of President of Zambia Michael Chilufya Sata.\" Following the death of the president parts of the article were quoted by the New York Times, and Agence France-Presse (AFP).\\n\\nPersonal life\\nDr. Ruwe is married to Dr. Mathilda Bwalya Ruwe a medical doctor and research scientist. He is a father of three children, Thembinkosi, Dalitso (Dr. Dalitso Ruwe) and Rachel, and a grandfather of three, Martin, Zoe and Gabriel.\\n\\nNewspaper articles by Ruwe\\nSanger Herald:\\nIn the line of duty: Sanger born earns purple heart|\\nMichael Montelongo sworn in as mayor|\\nPromoting Sanger to Valley radio listeners|\\nSquaw Valley residents fear private metering|\\nSeventy years and still going strong: Bill and Florine Kyler are part of Sanger’s history|\\nNew equipment for city playgrounds|\\nLower electric bills in your future –City considers options to reduce cost|\\nCombating speeders – Police will get more tools to slow down speeders|\\nCity borrows DBCP funds to buy truck: Previous loans have been repaid|\\n park in Sanger\\'s future: Proposition 84 dollars may be used|\\n\\nOrange Cove and Mountain Times:\\nQuestions, legalities arise over Orange Cove declaring Emergency status of BMX track|\\nPublic works plan bewildering|\\nLocal fire department and city at odds over funds|\\n\\nThe Fowler Ensign:\\nMary-Anne Ward named new postmaster for Fowler Post Office|\\nIn the Spotlight – New church joins Fowler community|\\nIn the Spotlight- Fowler librarian Benjamin Langstraat|\\n\\nThe Reedley Exponent:\\nStreet Faire\\'s 20th Anniversary – First Saturday in May is Reedley tradition|\\nMountain residents question cancelled water meeting|\\nMeasure K – Kings Canyon Unified School District $32 million bond|\\nMeasure E – Sierra Kings District Hospital $20 million bond package|\\n\\nMadera Tribune:\\nNeighbors and Friends – Loving the thrills of fiction writing – Author Bonnie Hearn Hill|\\nThe women\\'s improvement club|\\nThe Flume: Water transportation system helped economic development|\\nWater Battle: Fights over Valley’s resource go back to 1860|\\n\\nTulare Advance- Register:\\nIt\\'s growth vs. preservation|\\n\\nMid-Valley Publishing:\\nCities may seek Ag land for future development\\n\\nReferences\\nThe Historian (2010) Vol. 71 Number 3., p.\\xa0740 Wiley-Blackwell Tampa FL.\\n\\nZambia National Broadcasting Corporation (1990) Profile on Radio 4 by Frank Mutubila\\n\\nNairobi Times (1980) Everyman\\'s Everyman by Margaretta Wagacheru\\n\\nGunda, M.

      "113 ['Kenneth Gilmore Ryder (April 30, 1924 – October 29, 2012) was the 4th president of Northeastern University, a post he held from 1975 to 1989.  Ryder began his career in education as a history teacher in 1949 and moved into administration in 1955. As president of Northeastern, he contributed to the growth of the student population to nearly 50,000 students, a $43\\xa0million fund-raising drive, and the construction of nine campus buildings.\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nKenneth (Ken) Ryder was born on April 30, 1924 in Brockton, MA to Russell Gilmore Ryder and Etta Carr Ryder.  Russell Ryder (b. Sept. 2, 1892– d. Jan. 25, 1965) was a veteran of World War I, serving in the 312th Field Signal Battalion as a signal officer in France during the war.  Russell had learned the telegraph trade from his father and uncles who were all telegraph officers. For many years, Russell was a payroll officer for the C.S. Pierce Shoe Company, in Brockton, MA. During World War II, Russell Ryder put his telegraph skills to work again and was employed by the Submarine Signal Company of Boston helping with the war effort.  Russell married Etta Coffin Carr (Dec. 19, 1888 – May 11, 1986) on July 19, 1921.  Etta grew up in Brockton, MA and graduated from Brockton High School in 1904.  Etta and Russell had one child, Kenneth, in 1924. \\n  \\nKen Ryder was a good student throughout his early years, excelling in history and public speaking. His public speaking ability was something that was honed as a part of the debate team and this was a skill that was admired throughout his lifetime. Ryder graduated from Brockton High School in 1940, giving the graduation address, and was named an Augustus Howe Buck Fellow, which included a full scholarship to Boston University.  Ryder became the first in his family to attend college. (In later years his father received a law degree by correspondence, and Russell had hoped that Ken would go on to become a lawyer as well).  Ryder once said, “My father thought law was the ideal profession, and it was there I set my sights.\"', 'But without the scholarship, there would have been no college and that fact shaped Ryder’s view of higher education for the rest of his life. \"My father had lost his job, and I was working after school and summers to help out. I wanted to go to Harvard or Boston University, but I\\'d pretty much given up the idea of college at all. It was a teacher who urged me to apply to BU and it accepted me. Still, that wouldn\\'t have been possible without the award. The fellowship shaped my view about the importance of helping people – whatever their financial background – to get a college education so they can develop their potential.\"\\n\\nRyder majored in History at Boston University and for the next six years, Ryder remained an August Buck Fellow, earning an A.B. from Boston University in 1946 and an M.A. from Harvard in 1947. His undergraduate studies took six years to complete because they were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.\\n\\nNavy Service\\n\\nMoved by the invasion of Pearl Harbor, Ryder signed up for the naval reserves a month after the attack, and enlisted in the Navy on December 10, 1942 at the age of 18. He took a leave from his junior year at Boston University and undertook months of naval training before being deployed to the Pacific.  Training included a 32-week officer training class at Harvard University where he learned celestial navigation and naval communication. (From 1942–1943, Harvard University provided full-time instruction to Army and Navy servicemen who were part of the Army Specialized Training and the Navy V-12 Programs which were designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy during World War II).', \"From the V-12 program, most of the Navy candidates went on to a four-month course at a reserve midshipmen's school, an indoctrination school for officers.  Ryder’s four-month training was held at Camp MacDonough Midshipman School in Plattsburgh, NY. After leaving Camp MacDonough, Ryder was assigned as a naval officer on the USS Landing Craft Infantry (Large) 803 [(LCI (L) 803].\\n\\nWorld War II\\n\\nIn 1944 Ryder went into active service as a communications officer on the LCI(L) 803, a landing craft bound for the Pacific theater which would participate in the landing at Okinawa.  There were three officers and twenty-five enlisted men in the original crew of the LCI(L) 803. On August 20, 1944 Ryder and the rest of the ship’s crew completed its training and received orders to report to New York for the outfitting and commissioning of LCI (L) 803.\\n\\nThe following is an excerpt of the History of the LCI (L) 803 compiled by William F. Confalone: A full history of the LCI (L) 803's service in World War II can be found at: http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/15/150803h.htm\\n\\n“On Saturday, September 2, 1944, after a thorough inspection of the ship by the prospective Commanding Officer, the crew was mustered on the gun deck. Lt. Comdr. J.A. Jordan read his orders from the Chief of Naval Operations to accept the USS LCI (L) 803 for the Navy and placed the ship in full commission. ...\\n\\nOn December 7 the LCI (L) 803 reported to San Pedro, California, where at the Craig Shipbuilding she was converted to an LCI (M). With conversion to a mortar ship, the 803’s complement was increased. Twenty-five new enlisted men were received aboard in the last two weeks of December. Final preparations for going to sea were completed in early January. On January 6, 1945, this ship departed from San Pedro, California for Pearl Harbor, T.H. in company with eleven other LCI’s. ...\", 'The 803’s first action was in support of the landing operations at Purple Beach on Zamami Shima. The landing was successful and little enemy opposition was observed. On the 27th. this ship supported the attack on Takashiki Shima. The results were the same. On the second day considerably more accuracy was attained with the mortar fire. The assigned target area was blanketed with hits.\\n\\nOn the morning of April 7. the 803 was proceeding in Nago Wan to join the other ships of her division. Shortly after 0400 a Japanese aircraft dive-bombed the ship from directly ahead. The heavy bomb exploded less than 50 years off the port quarter of the ship. No casualties were suffered....\\n\\nOn April 28. the ship was again dive-bombed, again without suffering damage. The bombing occurred while the 803 was on patrol near Ie Shima. The bomb struck the water 75 to 100 yards astern. On the 29th. of April the 803 discontinued the active patrolling and took an anchored screening station in the anchorage south of Ie Shima. Throughout May and until June 14. she remained on this duty. Some of the bitterest air attacks occurred during the first weeks of May. The gun crews were often at their stations throughout most of the night. Numerous Kamikaze plane attacks were made in the vicinity of Ie Shima. Most LCI’s escaped such attacks however because of their small size and the presence in the area of more desirable targets....', 'The men aboard the 803 were awaiting orders to invade Japan when the City of Hiroshima was bombed on August 7, 1945. As a result, \"The 803 was released from duty at Okinawa on August 13. and returned to Leyte for necessary repairs and equally necessary relaxation for the men. The stay at Leyte was cut short by the official end of the war. The 803 returned to Okinawa on September 6. to prepare for the coming occupation of China. The trip to Okinawa was difficult one as the ships sailed into the path of a typhoon. Considerable time was lost and several days of rough weather were experienced. A second typhoon was ridden out in Buckner Bay a week after arriving at the island. The ship survived the second typhoon with little damage except the loss of two anchors. ...\\n\\nThe 803 left Okinawa in convoy on September 25. en route to Taku Bay, China. The First Marines were landed in the Tientsin area on September 30. and the 803 participated in landing troops during the first week of October. ...At the end of the month of November the 803 discontinued her duty as a liberty ship and on order made ready for sea.\" Ryder returned with the 803 to the United States, mustering out as a Lieutenant junior grade in 1946.\\n\\nAs stated by Antoinette Fredrick in her book on the history of Northeastern University, Coming of Age: The Ryder Years, “The war had brought the young lieutenant into firsthand contact with one of the momentous conflicts of western civilization, and this, along with American history, became the focus of his academic career. \\'It also made me realize I never wanted to fight with anyone,\" he was to say later. \"I\\'ve seldom met anyone I didn\\'t like and no one that I ever wanted to get mad at. The war confirmed that sense in me – that issues can be settled by discussion.\\'\" This became the defining character trait that guided his life—placid, thoughtful and unflappable, Ryder seldom argued or raised his voice, but could stand his ground and calmly debate the issues that mattered to him.\\n\\nMilitary Awards and Medal', 'Military Awards and Medal\\n\\nRyder was awarded a star for participation in the Asiatic-Pacific Area, and a star for the Philippine Liberation. He also awarded for the American Area and the World War II victory.\\n\\nWork at Northeastern University\\n\\nAfter returning from World War II, Ryder returned to BU where he graduated with a BA in history in 1946.  Ryder then enrolled in a Masters Program in History at Harvard University.', 'While working on his masters, Ryder began teaching at Cambridge Junior College and in 1949, accepted a position at Northeastern University as a history and government instructor.  He was a well-liked professor, full of enthusiasm for learning, and for the needs of his students.  Ryder often spent a good deal of time with his students, counseling them on academic and non-academic matters, and he was widely admired for his love of history and relaxed, but effective manner in the classroom.  In 1953 he was promoted to assistant professor and then to associate professor in 1956. In the following year, Ryder began to take on more administrative roles at the University first serving as faculty advisor of the freshman class and as Secretary to the faculty. In 1958, Ryder gave up the teaching side of his responsibilities altogether and was named Dean of Administration (1958–1966). In 1967 he became Vice President of University Administration (1967–1970), and Executive Vice President in 1971.  1975, largely due to his knowledge of the university administration and its procedures, his affection for the needs of the student body, and his close ties to the faculty,  Ryder was named the fourth president of Northeastern by the Board of Trustees after the retirement of Asa Knowles.', 'The face of Northeastern, both academically and physically, changed dramatically during Ryder’s tenure. Northeastern’s academic programs, as well as the physical campus, were expanded and improved and Ryder is largely credited with turning the once cold and asphalt-covered landscape of white brick buildings into a campus full of flowers, grass and trees.  By the last year of his presidency in 1989, over 19 academic centers and research institutes had been established, honors programs developed, satellite locations had been created, and numerous buildings added to the main campus. In addition to new academic structures, Boston Arena, the former home of the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics, was purchased from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1982 and became Matthews Arena, the home of the Northeastern Huskies Hockey Team.  However, despite this success of campus expansion, Ryder was well aware that Northeastern could not become a first class university without a first class library for their students.  The existing library was too small for the needs of the University, and from the early days of his presidency, Ryder undertook the goal of having a new library constructed.', \"“Ryder was adamant: a new library absolutely had to be built. Although no funding was in sight, a two-phase invitational design competition was launched in 1981. In January 1983, the Architects Collaborative was awarded the commission for a five-story,  library.\\n\\nNot until September 1986, after three years of intensive work, was sufficient funding secured-$13.5\\xa0million from the Department of Defense and $5\\xa0million from trustee and graduate George Snell-to inspire hope that the project would take concrete form. Another year elapsed before groundbreaking and another three years before the library finally opened in the fall of 1990. Although President Ryder retired in 1989, the dedication of the library a year later must be seen as the crowning achievement of his presidency.”\\n\\nIn addition to physical expansion, Ryder was committed to improving the quality and scope of the academic programs offered at Northeastern as well.  Having come from the History department, he was personally committed to establishment and expansion of academic programs in the arts and humanities. In addition to these areas, he also understood that Northeastern, with its long history of quality engineering programs, could play a role in the emerging technology fields. The first modern computer equipment was installed at the University under Ryder, and Northeastern established the nation's first College of Computer Science in 1982.  Research programs also increased during Ryder’s administration. In 1978 the University Council on Research and Scholarship was established to promote development of research and scholarship activities.\\n\\nAlways a teacher at heart, Ryder also worked to improve the quality of teaching at Northeastern. In 1978, he founded the Excellence in Teaching Awards, a merit program to recognize teachers, and in 1983, he established the Instructional Development Fund to encourage teachers to improve the quality of their teaching through experimentation with instructional content, innovative procedures, or technological resources.\", \"During his time as President, Ryder put particular focus on the role Northeastern could play as a leader in cooperative education, a program that had long been a crucial means of helping Northeastern students pay for their academic course work while in school.  Ryder wanted to shift the attitude around cooperative education away from a means of financing higher education, and focus more on the educational enrichment and job placement opportunities that the program could provide. As a result, co-op placements expanded both in number and in variety and Ryder made great strides in reaching out to employers to participate in the program. Ryder also took an active role in expanding cooperative education nationally and internationally. In 1981, Ryder became the founding chairman of the World Council on Cooperative Education conference (now the World Association on Cooperative Education), an international conference to expand and promote cooperative education at universities worldwide.\\n\\nRyder also believed strongly that Northeastern should play a role in the community it inhabited.  Looking for ways to develop strong relations between NU and the local community, in 1976 he created the Office of Community Development (renamed the Office of Community Affairs in 1981) to work on various community projects. In 1975, under Ryder’s leadership Northeastern participated in Phase II of the Boston public schools desegregation plan in which 21 Boston area colleges and universities each paired up with a specific Boston public school to assist in educational development. NU was paired with Madison Park High School in District 7.  NU also participated in the Southwest Corridor Project, an economic and environmental urban renewal project to improve Boston's transportation by developing the land near NU's property into residential, commercial, and light industrial enterprises. In 1986 the Ruggles Street MBTA Station was created.\", \"Ryder also understood the importance of having close and working relationships with elected officials at all levels of government. In 1979, he established the Office of Government Relations as a means to bring the concerns of the Northeastern community to City Hall, the United States Congress, and the Massachusetts State House.\\n\\nRyder was well liked by all who knew him because of his easy going attitude, but he could command a room with his speaking style. “Ken was a tremendous speaker. His voice was resonant, his tone perfectly pitched. He managed to sound as if he were talking one on one even if he were behind a podium and there were 800 people on the other side, or if he were at a desk and there were 40 faculty senators facing him, or if he were at a table confronting six agenda committee members. Ken always sounded extemporaneous. He never gave canned speeches. He didn't read from a text, he looked up, made eye contact and spoke.\\n\\n“This speaking talent, which has been remarked on by almost everyone who ever heard Ryder speak, gave his hearers the sense that their president was actually talking to rather than at them and went a long way toward establishing rapport.”\\n\\nAfter 40 years of service to Northeastern, fourteen of which he had served as President, Ryder submitted his resignation to NU's Board of Trustees in 1989. After stepping down as President, Ryder became Chancellor when John A. Curry, a former NU administrator, was appointed as his successor. Ryder retired from Northeastern in 2004 at the age of 80 having served Northeastern for 55 years.\\n\\nRyder died on October 29, 2012 at the age of 88.\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n1986 Cooperative Education in a New Era, Kenneth G.

Nicknamed \"Sid the Kid\" and dubbed \"The Next One\", Crosby was selected first overall by the Penguins in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Crosby is often considered to be one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.\\n\\nDuring his two-year major junior career with the Rimouski Océanic, he earned many awards and led his club to the 2005 Memorial Cup final. Océanic and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League retired Crosby\\'s jersey number 87 in 2019. Crosby debuted in the NHL during the 2005–06 season, recording 102 points and finishing as runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL Rookie of the Year. At 18 years and 253 days, he is the youngest player to date to reach 100 points in an NHL season. By his second season, he led the NHL with 120 points to capture the Art Ross Trophy, becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring title in any major North American sports league. That same season, Crosby won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league\\'s most valuable player (MVP) and the Lester B. Pearson Award for most outstanding player as judged by his peers. He started the 2007–08 season with the team\\'s captaincy and subsequently led them to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games. The Penguins returned to the Finals against Detroit the following year and won in seven games; Crosby became the youngest captain in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup.', \"In 2009–10, he received the Mark Messier Leadership Award and scored 51 goals, winning the Maurice Richard Trophy as the NHL's leading goal scorer. In early 2011, Crosby sustained a concussion that left him sidelined for the rest of the season and for most of the 2011–12 campaign. In 2014, Crosby again won the Hart Memorial Trophy as well as his second Art Ross Trophy (104 points) and his third Ted Lindsay Award. Crosby led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cup championships in 2016 and 2017, becoming the third player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) in consecutive years. In 2017, he won his second Richard Trophy and was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.\\n\\nInternationally, Crosby has represented Canada on numerous occasions. He won gold at the 2005 World Junior Championships, and was later named to Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Playing against the United States in the gold medal game, he scored the game-winning goal in overtime. Crosby captained Team Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics, winning his second consecutive Olympic gold medal. A year later, he led his country to gold in the World Championship in Prague, thus becoming a member of the Triple Gold Club and the only player in the club to have captained all three winning teams. In 2016, Crosby captained Canada to gold in the World Cup of Hockey and was elected MVP by a unanimous vote.\\n\\nEarly life\", 'Early life\\n\\nCrosby was born in the Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia on August 7, 1987 to Troy and Trina (née Forbes) Crosby. Crosby\\'s jersey number (87) and 2007 contract signing ($8.7\\xa0million per year) reflect his birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour and has a younger sister named Taylor. His father Troy was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He also played in the 1985 Memorial Cup and was drafted 240th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1984, but never played at the NHL level. Growing up, Crosby admired Steve Yzerman and, like his father, was a Canadiens fan. Crosby began playing hockey by himself in his basement at the age of two, shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a longstanding misconception that he was actually practising with the dryer; he learned to skate at age three.\\n\\nFrom age 12 to 15, Crosby attended Astral Drive Junior High School. He was a straight-A student and, according to the vice-principal, \"an amazing role model, who was really kind to students in the learning centre and to special needs kids\". At age 15, Crosby transferred to Shattuck-Saint Mary\\'s in Faribault, Minnesota to play with the school\\'s hockey program. While playing for the Rimouski Océanic of the QMJHL, Crosby went to Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick, where he graduated in 2005.\\n\\nPlaying career', \"Playing career\\n\\nMinor hockey\\nEarly in his minor hockey years, Crosby began attracting media attention for his play and gave his first newspaper interview at age seven. When Crosby was 13, Nova Scotia's Minor Hockey Council refused to allow him to play midget, a level of minor hockey designated for 15- to 17-year-olds. His family sued but lost. The following year, he entered the midget level with the triple-A Dartmouth Subways and went on to score a combined 217 regular season and playoff points, leading Dartmouth to a second-place finish at the 2002 Air Canada Cup. He was named the MVP and Top Scorer awards at the national tournament at the tournament banquet held after the preliminary round and he finished the tournament with 24 points (11 goals and 13 assists) in 7 games. Crosby was called up as a 14-year-old to play two games with the Maritime Junior A Hockey League's Truro Bearcats that season. Crosby had been drafted by the Bearcats in the 2001 MJAHL Draft as a 13-year-old.\\n\\nDuring his midget season, Crosby appeared on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents on and off the ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to not wearing his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so that he would not be recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.\\n\\nJunior career\", 'Junior career\\n\\nRimouski Océanic (2003–2005)\\nCrosby was selected first overall in the 2003 Midget Draft by the Rimouski Océanic of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). In his first exhibition game, he scored eight points, leading his teammates to nickname him \"Darryl\" (in reference to Darryl Sittler\\'s ten-point NHL game in 1976). In his first regular season game in the QMJHL, he scored one goal and added two assists. He was named QMJHL Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks at the start of the season and won the honour four more times as the season progressed. He was named QMJHL Player of the Month and Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Player of the Week three times each. Crosby finished his rookie QMJHL season with 54 goals and 81 assists over 59 games to capture the Jean Béliveau Trophy as the league\\'s leading point-scorer. He was further recognized with the RDS/JVC Trophy (overall rookie of the year) and Michel Brière Memorial Trophy (most valuable player), becoming the first QMJHL player to win all three major awards at once. Rounding out Crosby\\'s accolades for the 2003–04 regular season were QMJHL All-Rookie and First All-Star Team honours, as well as Offensive Rookie, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year Awards. As a team, the Océanic led the Eastern Division with 34 wins and 76 points. After receiving a first-round bye in the 2003 QMJHL playoffs, they defeated the Shawinigan Cataractes in the quarterfinals, then were eliminated by the Moncton Wildcats in the semi-finals. Crosby recorded 16 points (7 goals and 9 assists) over 9 playoff games.', 'During the off-season, the World Hockey Association, a major professional league proposed to rival the NHL, held an Entry Draft on July 17, 2004. Holding the first overall selection, Toronto chose Crosby. The following month, it was reported that Crosby turned down a US$7.5\\xa0million contract over three years to play for Hamilton. Crosby told reporters that while \"it took a lot to say no to that much money\", he \"work[ed] hard most of his life to play in the NHL\". The contract would have paid him $2.5\\xa0million annually and an additional $2\\xa0million payout regardless of whether the WHA was realized as a legitimate league or not. However, it was not clarified how Hamilton could have signed Crosby, as Toronto held his WHA playing rights. Nevertheless, the WHA never materialized.', \"Returning to the Océanic for the 2004–05 season, Crosby continued dominating the league, leading the league with 66 goals, 102 assists and 168 points over 62 games to capture his second consecutive Beliveau Trophy. Joining Crosby on Rimouski's top line were wingers Dany Roussin and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, who finished second and third in league-scoring with 116 and 114 points respectively. In addition to his scoring title, Crosby was once again awarded Most Valuable Player, Offensive Player and Personality of the Year, while repeating as a QMJHL First All-Star. The Océanic finished the regular season with the best record in the league, registering 45 wins and 98 points, including a league record-setting 28-game undefeated streak. They went on to capture the President's Cup as QMJHL playoff champions, defeating the Halifax Mooseheads in the finals. Crosby led the playoffs with 31 points (14 goals and 17 assists) over 13 games, earning him the Guy Lafleur Trophy as post-season MVP. With their QMJHL championship, the Océanic qualified for the 2005 Memorial Cup, Canada's national major junior tournament. Meeting the London Knights in the final, the Océanic were shut-out 4–0. Despite the loss, Crosby was named to the Tournament All-Star Team and captured the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as the competition's leading scorer with 11 points (6 goals and 5 assists) over 5 games. Knights forward Corey Perry was awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the MVP. Soon after, he attended the NHL prospect combine in preparation for the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.\\n\\nRimouski Océanic retired jersey number 87 in Crosby's honor in 2019, and the QMJHL also retired the number for all of its teams.\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins (2005–present)\\n\\nRise to superstardom (2005–2007)\", 'Rimouski Océanic retired jersey number 87 in Crosby\\'s honor in 2019, and the QMJHL also retired the number for all of its teams.\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins (2005–present)\\n\\nRise to superstardom (2005–2007)\\n\\nEntering the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Crosby was listed first overall in the NHL Central Scouting Bureau and International Scouting Services\\' respective rankings of prospects. He also won the Mike Bossy Trophy as the QMJHL\\'s best prospect. Crosby was selected first overall in the draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 30, 2005. Due to the labour lockout that suspended the entire 2004–05 NHL season, positioning for the 2005 draft was conducted via a weighted lottery based on each team\\'s playoff appearances and draft lottery victories in the last four years. This lottery system led to the draft being popularly referred to as the \"Sidney Crosby Lottery\" or the \"Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\".', '\"Sid the Kid\", a nickname given to him by the media early in his career, made his NHL debut on October 5, 2005 against the New Jersey Devils, and registered an assist on the team\\'s first goal of the season, scored by Mark Recchi in a 5–1 loss. He scored his first NHL goal in the Penguins\\' home opener on October 8 against goaltender Hannu Toivonen of the Boston Bruins. Despite having registered two assists for a three-point night, the Penguins were defeated 7–6 in overtime. Crosby began his rookie season playing alongside Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux. Unfortunately, Lemieux was forced to retire due to an irregular heartbeat after having played just 26 games of the season. Near the midway point of the season, Penguins head coach Ed Olczyk was fired and replaced by Michel Therrien on December 15, 2005. The following day, Therrien designated Crosby as an alternate captain for the Penguins. The move drew criticism from some hockey pundits, including Don Cherry, who claimed that Crosby did not have the experience for the position. Cherry said, \"An 18-year-old kid says he\\'s going to give us ideas. What, from the Quebec League, he\\'s going to give them ideas? Come on. That\\'s ridiculous.\" Although hopes were high in Pittsburgh for the club to succeed, largely in part to the beginning of Crosby\\'s NHL career and bolstered by the acquisitions of Sergei Gonchar, Žigmund Pálffy, and Mark Recchi, the Penguins still finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference.', 'Nevertheless, Crosby\\'s first NHL campaign was a personal success as he established franchise records in assists (63) and points (102) for a rookie, both of which were previously held by Mario Lemieux. He also became the youngest player in NHL history to score 100 points in a single season, and only the seventh rookie ever to hit the benchmark. Overall, Crosby finished sixth in the NHL scoring race and seventh in the NHL in assists. Among Canadian NHL players, he trailed only Joe Thornton and Dany Heatley. Throughout the season, Crosby had battled with Washington Capitals forward and 2004 first-overall pick Alexander Ovechkin for the rookie scoring lead. He finished second to Ovechkin\\'s 106 points and also lost to the Capitals forward for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year. It marked the start of a rivalry that would help \"define the league\" for over a decade. Throughout his first season, Crosby was accused by opposing players and coaches of taking dives and complaining to officials, which was typically attributed to his youth. He became the first rookie to earn 100 penalty minutes and 100 points in the same season, which magnified his reputation for complaining to NHL officials. Hockey analyst Kelly Hrudey compared Crosby to Wayne Gretzky, who had a similar reputation as a \"whiner\" in his youth, and suggested that as Crosby matured, he would mellow out and his reputation would fade.', 'In his second NHL season, Crosby built on his rookie success. On October 28, 2006, Crosby scored his first NHL hat-trick in an 8–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. His success against the Flyers continued as just over six weeks later, on December 13, he recorded the first six-point game of his career (one goal and five assists). The multi-point effort vaulted Crosby into the NHL scoring lead, which he would retain for the remainder of the season. He finished the 2006–07 with 36 goals and 84 assists in 79 games to become the first teenager to lead the NHL in scoring since Wayne Gretzky in 1980. Being only 19 years old at the time, he became the youngest player in NHL history to win the Art Ross Trophy and the youngest scoring champion in any major North American professional sport.', 'Crosby\\'s second NHL season also saw significant improvements for the Penguins franchise as a whole, as the emergence of Calder Trophy-winner Evgeni Malkin and runner-up Jordan Staal complemented the club\\'s offence. As a result, the Penguins jumped from last place in the Eastern Conference the previous season to fifth for the club\\'s first playoff appearance since 2001. Playing the Ottawa Senators in the opening round, Crosby scored a goal in his Stanley Cup playoff debut in a 6–3 loss. He finished the series with five points in five games as the Penguins were ousted by the eventual Stanley Cup runner-up. Following the Penguins defeat, Crosby was named Pittsburgh\\'s team captain on May 31, 2007, making him (at 19 years, 9 months, and 24 days) the youngest team captain in NHL history. During the season, the Penguins offered him the captaincy, but he turned it down. In the press conference naming him the team captain, he explained:\\n\"I just thought it wasn\\'t right for me. As a team, we were playing great and you don\\'t want to disrupt things like that. Individually, I was not ready to accept that responsibility quite yet. Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. I understand there is going to be a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it\\'s something I\\'m ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I\\'m just excited to get things going.\"\\n\\nAt the NHL\\'s annual awards show later in June 2007, Crosby completed a rare off-season \"hat-trick\", winning the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Lester B. Pearson Award in addition to his previously-clinched Art Ross Trophy. He became the youngest player in NHL history to win the Lester B. Pearson, and only the second youngest player ever to win the Hart (after Gretzky). He became the youngest player ever to be named to the NHL\\'s First All-Star Team.\\n\\nRunner–up and first Stanley Cup title (2007–2009)', \"Runner–up and first Stanley Cup title (2007–2009)\\n\\nWith Crosby's initial three-year, entry-level contract set to expire at the end of the following season, the Penguins signed him to a five-year, $43.5\\xa0million contract extension on July 10, 2007, ensuring his stay with the Penguins through the 2012–13 season. Midway through the subsequent season, Crosby recorded a Gordie Howe hat-trick on December 20, 2007 in a game against the Boston Bruins. His first assist came 55\\xa0seconds into the first period. At 8:26 of the same period, Crosby scored to give the Penguins a 2–0 lead. Then, five minutes and nine seconds into the second frame, Crosby fought ex-Penguin defenceman Andrew Ference to complete the hat-trick. This was Crosby's first NHL fight. In the NHL's first Winter Classic (with a record crowd of 71,217 fans in attendance), Crosby scored the shootout winner in heavy snowfall to defeat the Buffalo Sabres. However, two weeks later, on January 18, 2008, Crosby suffered a high ankle sprain crashing leg-first into the boards in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. As a result, he missed the 2008 All-Star Game, to which he was named a starter. After missing 21 games, he returned on March 4 against the Lightning and earned an assist. However, two games after his return, he felt his ankle was not up to shape and decided that he needed more time for it to heal. Crosby consequently sat out of the Penguins' next seven games and returned on March 27, 2008 to help the Penguins defeat the New York Islanders 3–1. Despite his injury-shortened campaign, Crosby still managed 72 points in just 53 games.\", \"Crosby's absence from the Penguins' line-up served as a stepping stone for teammate Evgeni Malkin, who, now in his second season, was developing into a superstar in his own right. Picking up the offensive slack, Malkin finished second in league scoring to Alexander Ovechkin and was also a Hart Memorial Trophy nominee as MVP honours also went to Ovechkin. In addition to Crosby's return to the line-up late in the regular season, the Penguins acquired star winger Marián Hossa from the Atlanta Thrashers at the trade deadline, placing the club in a strong position to make a deep playoff run. Pittsburgh finished the regular season as Atlantic Division champions and just two points shy of the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens. In a rematch of the previous year's opening round, the Penguins began the 2008 playoffs facing the Ottawa Senators, whom they quickly swept in four games. After then defeating the New York Rangers and archrival Philadelphia Flyers, each in five games, the Penguins reached the final round for the first time since 1992, to face the Detroit Red Wings. After being shut-out as a team for the first two games of the series, Crosby scored the first two goals of game three as the series shifted to Pittsburgh to fuel a 3–2 win. The Penguins lost the next game and despite staving off defeat in game five, they were overcome by the Red Wings in six games. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.\", 'Early in the following season, on October 18, 2008, Crosby scored one goal and three assists to surpass benchmarks of 100\\xa0goals, 200\\xa0assists, and 300\\xa0points for his career. On the play in which Crosby scored, teammate Evgeni Malkin assisted to record his own 200th point. As a result, Crosby had a team trainer cut the puck in half so both players could commemorate the achievement. Minor injury troubles kept Crosby from five games early in the season as he was listed day-to-day, but he was, for the most part, able to bounce back from the previous injury-riddled season and stay healthy. He recorded 33 goals and 70 assists to finish third in league scoring, as Evgeni Malkin captured his first career Art Ross Trophy. Entering the 2009 playoffs as the defending Prince of Wales Trophy winners, the Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the opening round before meeting the Washington Capitals for a highly publicized second-round matchup. The series was heavily followed as it pitted Ovechkin of the Capitals against both Crosby and Malkin, who together finished as the league\\'s top three scorers that season. In the second game, Crosby and Ovechkin recorded matching three-goal efforts for their first career playoff hat tricks in a 4–3 Capitals victory. Despite being down 2–0 in the series, Crosby and the Penguins won the next three games and eventually defeated the Capitals in a seventh and deciding game, in which Crosby added another two goals. Following a sweep of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final, Crosby opted against recent NHL tradition and picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy, which he had left untouched the previous year. In explanation of the change of heart, Crosby said, \"We didn\\'t touch the trophy last year, and obviously we didn\\'t have the result we wanted ... Although we haven\\'t accomplished exactly what we want ... we can still enjoy it.\"', 'The Penguins met the Detroit Red Wings for the second straight year in the Finals, and this time Crosby won his first Stanley Cup title in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win the Stanley Cup since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup in the history of the trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding Game 7, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit\\'s players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying, \"Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn\\'t come over to shake his hand. That\\'s ridiculous, especially as their captain.\" Crosby replied afterward, saying, \"I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it\\'s not easy waiting around... I understand if they don\\'t feel like waiting around. But you know what? It\\'s the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I think that was a pretty unreasonable comment.\"', 'Injury–plagued years (2010–2012)\\nIn the 2009–10 NHL season, Crosby tied Tampa Bay Lightning centre Steven Stamkos for the lead in goals scored, with 51 goals, earning the Rocket Richard Trophy. He also garnered 58 assists for a total of 109 points, enough to tie with Alexander Ovechkin for second in league points, trailing only the Vancouver Canucks\\' Henrik Sedin\\'s 112. Crosby was also named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award. Crosby won the Mark Messier Leadership Award, getting recognized as a \"superior leader within the sport, setting a positive example through on-ice performance, motivation of team members and a dedication to the community\". This was the second time he had received this honour, the other being in January 2007, during the award\\'s first year when it was presented monthly. He was also included on NHL\\'s all-decade second team of 2000s.\\n\\nCrosby\\'s Penguins were defeated in the second round of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, losing to the Montreal Canadiens in seven games. Crosby had 19 points in 13 games in the playoffs, though through seven games against the Canadiens, he had only one goal and four assists. Game 7 was also the last game to be played at Mellon Arena, the Penguins\\' home rink since the start of the franchise. On July 27, 2010, Crosby joined his mentor Mario Lemieux to be the first to skate on the new ice at the Consol Energy Center. The two skated for about five minutes before being joined on the ice by a group of young hockey fans all wearing Lemieux\\'s 66 or Crosby\\'s 87 jerseys.', \"In the 2010–11 season, Crosby had a 25-game point streak, which began on November 5, 2010 against the Anaheim Ducks and ended on December 28, 2010 against the New York Islanders. During this streak, he had 27 goals (including three hat-tricks) and 24 assists for 51 points. This streak was tied for 11th-longest point streak in NHL history, and he was named First Star of the Month in both November and December. On January 3, 2011, Crosby was selected as a 2011 All-Star, along with teammates Evgeni Malkin, Marc-André Fleury and Kris Letang. However, neither Crosby nor Malkin were available to play in the All-Star Game due to injuries, and rookie Jeff Skinner (along with Paul Stastny) were named as replacements. In consecutive games – the 2011 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2011, against the Washington Capitals and then January 5 against the Tampa Bay Lightning – Crosby suffered hits to his head from Dave Steckel and Victor Hedman respectively. After experiencing several concussion symptoms, Crosby did not return for the rest of the regular season, and he missed the 2011 playoffs. The Penguins were further crippled when Evgeni Malkin suffered a torn ACL and MCL, taking him out for the rest of the season and leaving the Penguins without their two highest-scoring players. Despite Crosby's injury and subsequent absence for the final 41 games of the season, he finished as the Penguins' leading scorer. His 66 points in 41 games were 16 points ahead of the second-highest team scorer, defenceman Kris Letang. In so doing, Crosby set an NHL record for fewest games played by an NHL team's points leader.\", 'Crosby missed the first 20 games of the 2011–12 season due to the lingering effects of his concussion. He returned on November 21, 2011 in a game against the New York Islanders, scoring two goals and two assists in a 5–0 shutout for the Penguins. However, after playing another seven games – scoring a total of 12 points in 8 games – Crosby\\'s concussion-like symptoms returned in December 2011, possibly following an elbow hit by David Krejčí in his eighth game of the season. Despite passing a successful ImPACT test, Crosby decided not to return on the ice until he felt perfectly fine, stating that he also must \"listen to [his] body\". Crosby returned to action on March 15, 2012, scoring an assist in a 5–2 win against the New York Rangers. Despite only playing 22 games, Crosby recorded 29 assists to go with 8 goals for 37 points, including his 600th career point. He later credited neurologists at UPMC and chiropractic neurologist Ted Carrick with helping him return to hockey.', 'Crosby\\'s return in advance of the playoffs resulted in many experts predicting that the Penguins would win their second Stanley Cup title in four years, and though the Penguins were accordingly picked to oust the Philadelphia Flyers in their first-round series, it was acknowledged that it would be a tough series for both teams. The Flyers shocked the Penguins by winning the first three consecutive games, the third of which saw the teams combine for 158 penalty minutes. After the 8–4 loss in Game 3, Crosby was widely criticized for his conduct during the game, and for his testy post-game interview. When asked about an incident where Flyer forward Jakub Voráček had dropped his glove and Crosby swatted it away with his stick before Voráček could pick it up, Crosby replied, saying, \"I don\\'t like any guy on their team there, so his glove was near me, went to pick it up, and I pushed it, so yeah, that\\'s... [...] I don\\'t like them. Because I don\\'t like them. I don\\'t like... I don\\'t like any guy on their team.\" When the interviewer suggested that he could have skated away, Crosby replied, \"Skate away? Yeah, well, I didn\\'t that time.\" The Penguins went on to win the next two games, but ultimately lost the series in Game 6. Crosby would finish with three goals and five assists in the six games. On June 28, 2012, the Penguins announced that Crosby agreed to a 12-year, $104.4\\xa0million contract extension set to keep Crosby in Pittsburgh through to the end of the 2024–25 NHL season.\\n\\nIndividual awards and playoff disappointments (2012–2015)', \"Individual awards and playoff disappointments (2012–2015)\\n\\nThe start of the 2012–13 was postponed until January 2013 due to the owners locking out the players as negotiations took place to solidify a new collective agreement for the players. During this time, Crosby was a regular attendee of meetings taking place between National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) representatives and NHL owners. The lock-out began on September 15, 2012 and ended on January 6, 2013 with the NHL regular season beginning on January 19. During the 119-day lock-out, Crosby was often questioned about his future plans should the lockout persist, and said on more than one occasion that he was considering contract offers from various teams in European leagues (where many NHL players went so that they could continue playing in a professional capacity while waiting for the lock-out to end or for the NHL season to be officially cancelled). Crosby continued to practice and participated with other NHL players who did not go overseas in several exhibition games open to the public.\", \"With the season finally underway in late January, Crosby set the pace for scoring, totalling 31 points (9 goals and 22 assists) through the first 21 games. He remained hot through March, scoring another 25 points (6 goals and 19 assists) in 15 games as the Penguins went unbeaten over this stretch. However, his regular season came to an abrupt end on March 30 in a home game against the New York Islanders. Crosby's teammate Brooks Orpik unleashed a slapshot which caught Crosby in the mouth, causing the centreman to lose several teeth. Crosby was down on the ice for several minutes before the medical staff was able to help him to the dressing room with Crosby holding a towel over his face. Initially, the prognosis was not severe, but it was discovered a short while later that Crosby had broken his jaw and would require several rounds of reconstructive dental surgery. He missed the final 12 games of the regular season and finished fourth in the scoring race, losing the title to Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis by four points.\", \"Crosby returned to the ice May 5 for the Penguins' second game against their first-round playoff opponents, the New York Islanders, ironically, the team Pittsburgh had been playing when Crosby was injured. Despite two goals from Crosby, Pittsburgh lost the game 3–2, tying the series at one game apiece. The Penguins would ultimately prevail 4–2 in the series over the Isles with Crosby scoring nine points (three goals and six assists) in the five games in which he played. Crosby and the Penguins moved on to face the Ottawa Senators in the second round, with Crosby scoring a hat-trick in Game 2 of the series. Pittsburgh quickly defeated Ottawa four games to one in the series with a still-hot Crosby finishing the series with four goals and two assists. The Eastern Conference Finals came down to what many felt were the two best teams in the conference: Pittsburgh and Boston. Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask put on an outstanding performance, shutting down Pittsburgh's potent offence with the help of a stifling defensive effort from his teammates. The Penguins were held to just two goals in the series, with Rask stopping 134 of 136 shots on goal (.985%). Crosby, who was strong for the Penguins in the regular season and through the first two rounds of the playoffs was held off the score sheet entirely, finishing the series with no goals and no assists on 13 shots. The Bruins swept the Penguins in four-straight games, ending Crosby's bid for a second Stanley Cup championship. In the off-season, Crosby was awarded his second Ted Lindsay Award and finished as runner-up to the Hart Memorial Trophy and Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.\", \"Crosby put together a healthy and productive campaign in 2013–14, playing 80 games for the first time since the 2009–10 season. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and a league-leading 68 assists, marking the first time in his career that he led the league in assists. He also finished with a league-high 104 points, winning the Art Ross Trophy for the second time in his career. He also went on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy and the Ted Lindsay Award. Finishing first overall in the Metropolitan Division, the Penguins were matched-up with a new division rival, the Columbus Blue Jackets, in the first round of the 2014 playoffs. Despite a very back-and-forth series and not a single goal by Crosby, the Penguins defeated the Jackets in six games to advance to a second-round matchup with the New York Rangers. Going into their second-round series with the Rangers, Crosby looked to end a long playoff goal drought, which dated back to the 2013 Conference Finals against the Boston Bruins. After dropping Game 1 at home, Crosby broke his goal drought in Game 2 as the Pens tied the series at 1–1 heading back to Madison Square Garden. The Penguins would capitalize on their Game 2 win, taking the next two games and eliminating the Rangers home-ice advantage. However, the Rangers would quickly rebound, winning Game 5, 6 and 7, sending the Penguins home without a prize for the fifth straight season. The team's collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Ray Shero, replacing him with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as GM was to fire Dan Bylsma as head coach, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was the new head coach.\", 'Crosby finished the 2014–15 season with the highest point-per-game average and a total of 84 points, trailing only John Tavares (86 points) and Art Ross winner Jamie Benn (87 points). On November 26, 2014, Crosby scored his 800th career point, becoming the sixth-fastest player in NHL history to reach that milestone. On January 4, 2015, in a game against Philadelphia, Crosby scored his 300th career NHL goal. Despite a strong start to the season, the injury-plagued Penguins entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\\'s second wild card. Facing the New York Rangers, Crosby helped even the series with two goals in Game 2. Despite this, the Penguins were defeated in five games and was eliminated in the first round for the first time since the 2012 playoffs.\\n\\nBack-to-back Stanley Cups (2015–2017)\\nStarting the 2015–16 season, the Penguins went through a major overhaul of their roster, adding a number of offensive players such as right winger Phil Kessel. Despite a line-up laced with some of the world\\'s finest offensive talents, Crosby struggled to score points, as he and the team had for much of the Johnston era. By the time Johnston was fired on December 12, 2015, after posting a 15–10–3 record through 28 games, some media outlets began speculating that Crosby had aged out of his prime scoring years. On December 16, The Washington Post wrote, \"Sidney Crosby has widely been regarded as the NHL\\'s best player since he burst on the scene as a rookie in 2005 ... But Crosby just hasn\\'t been himself this season, scoring just six goals in 29 games and sitting with a plus/minus of minus-seven. All players go through slumps, but it is clear that the Crosby we knew has been on the decline for some time.\" His slow start was capped off by not being selected as a starter for the 2016 NHL All-Star Game.', 'However, under new head coach Mike Sullivan, the 28-year-old turned his season around, outscoring all NHL players from December 12 through the end of the season. On February 2, Crosby scored three-straight goals for his first natural hat-trick in more than five years. Four days later, Crosby scored his 900th, 901st and 902nd career NHL points to fuel a 3–2 overtime comeback victory over the Florida Panthers. He tallied at least 1 point in 15 of Pittsburgh\\'s 16 games in March, including six multi-point efforts, and was subsequently named the NHL\\'s First Star of the Month. On April 2, Crosby recorded his 600th NHL assist as the Penguins clinched their berth in the 2016 playoffs. Six days later, he scored in overtime against Washington Capitals to secure home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and 85 points in 80 games, including a career-high nine game-winning goals, and was voted team MVP for the sixth time in his career. His two-way game also received league-wide praise, with Hockey Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman stating that Crosby would be a good candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league\\'s best defensive forward. Crosby\\'s comeback also impressed Wayne Gretzky, who said, \"He had a tough start, but the sign of an elite athlete is a guy that battles through it. He didn\\'t point any fingers, he just battled through it, and I don\\'t think there is any question the last 40 or so games, he made a case for the MVP. He was that good. He went to another level.\" On May 7, Crosby was named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. He finished as the first runner-up with 800 points and 11 first-place votes.', \"After losing to New York in the past two playoffs, the Penguins eliminated the Rangers in the first round, winning four games to one, after losing to the Rangers by the same series margin in the first round the previous year. Crosby led the team in scoring with three goals and eight points. The Penguins then eliminated the Presidents' Trophy-winning Washington Capitals in six games, without much offensive production from either Crosby (two assists) or Malkin (one goal and one assist). Advancing to their first Conference Final since 2013, Crosby scored the overtime winner against the Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 2. The goal was scored 40 seconds into overtime for a 3–2 win, the fastest overtime goal in Penguins' playoff history, and the first of his career in the playoffs. In the following game, he scored the game-winning goal in a 4–2 victory. After dropping the next two games, Crosby scored his third game-winning goal of the series in Game 6, forcing a final game in Pittsburgh. Defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning 2–1 in Game 7, Crosby helped his team win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Final against the San Jose Sharks. In the series, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in six games to earn Crosby his second Stanley Cup title. He became the ninth player to win the Stanley Cup twice as well as two Olympic gold medals. Finishing the playoffs with 19 points (6 goals and 13 assists), including the primary helper on the Cup-winning goal scored by Kris Letang, Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\", 'Crosby missed the first six games of the 2016–17 season after being diagnosed with a concussion just a few days before the season opener against the Washington Capitals. Upon his return, he scored 30 goals in his first 45 games, and on February 16, 2017, he registered an assist on a Chris Kunitz goal against the Winnipeg Jets to reach 1,000 NHL points, doing so in just his 757th game to become the 12th-fastest (and 11th-youngest) player to reach that milestone. He also participated in his first NHL All-Star Game since 2007, winning the shooting accuracy segment of the Skills Competition. He was named team MVP and finished the season as the runner up for the Art Ross Trophy with 44 goals and 89 points in 75 games. It marked the eighth time he finished a season in the top-three in NHL scoring, tying Mario Lemieux, Stan Mikita and Phil Esposito for the third-most instances in history behind only Wayne Gretzky (15 times) and Gordie Howe (12 times). With his 44 goals, Crosby captured the Rocket Richard Trophy for the second time in his career. Crosby was also named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award.', \"Entering the 2017 playoffs as the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in five games before meeting the Washington Capitals in the second round. After winning the first two games on the road, Crosby sustained a concussion after suffering an injury from a slash and cross-check from Alexander Ovechkin and Matt Niskanen in Game 3. He missed Game 4 but returned to practice the next day and played in Game 5. The Penguins would eventually eliminate the Capitals in Game 7, with Crosby assisting on the series-winning goal. The Penguins then defeated the Ottawa Senators in a gruelling seven-game series to secure their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final. Crosby had the primary assist on the series-clinching goal, scored by Chris Kunitz in double overtime. Facing the Nashville Predators in the Finals, Pittsburgh jumped out to a two-game lead, despite being outplayed for long stretches in both games. The Predators responded by tying up the series, winning Game 3 and 4 at home. In Game 5, the Penguins' captain delivered a dominant performance, adding three assists in a 6–0 win to pass Lemieux for most Stanley Cup Final points (20) in franchise history. After defeating the Predators 2–0 in Game 6, the Penguins became the first team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings, and the first to do so in the salary cap era. Crosby won his second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, only the third player to do so after Bernie Parent (1974, 1975) and Mario Lemieux (1991, 1992). He finished second in scoring behind Evgeni Malkin with 27 points (8 goals and 19 assists) in 24 games.\", 'Recent years (2017–present)\\nIn the 2017–18 season, Crosby appeared in all 82 of Pittsburgh\\'s regular season games for the first time in his career, finishing with 29 goals and 60 assists for 89 points.

The Penguins began their 2018 playoff campaign against the Philadelphia Flyers. In Game 1 of the Battle of Pennsylvania, Crosby recorded a natural hat-trick in a 7–0 win. On April 18, in Game 4, Crosby passed Mario Lemieux as the Penguins\\' all-time playoff points leader with 173. The Penguins ultimately defeated the Flyers in six games, with Crosby scoring 6 goals and 13 points. After the series, retired Hockey Hall of Fame centre Bryan Trottier said of Crosby, \"Sid has a wonderful gift to maintain his composure and not get rattled. You like the emotion he shows, too. I think he fires his team up, and that\\'s why he\\'s wearing the \\'C\\' [for captain].\" The Penguins were eventually eliminated in Game 6 of the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, ending Penguins\\'s bid for a three-peat. Crosby finished with 21 points (9 goals and 12 assists) in 12 games, pushing his career playoff total to 185, tied with Steve Yzerman for tenth-most all-time.', \"On January 3, 2019, Crosby was selected to play in the NHL All-Star Game for the eighth time in his career. He scored four goals and four assists, helping the Metropolitan Division to victory; his efforts won him his first All-Star MVP award, making him the sixth in NHL history to have won that award after having won the Conn Smythe Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy. During the 2018–19 season, Crosby passed Mario Lemieux to become the Penguins' all-time leader in games played (916), and moved into second place on the Pens' all-time scoring list with his 440th career goal in a 5–1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on March 3, 2019. Two days later, he became the 48th player in NHL history to score at least 1,200 career points. He finished the season with 100 points (35 goals and 65 assists), the first time he has reached the 100-point mark since scoring 104 points in 2013–14. Crosby finished 4th in voting for the Selke Trophy and became a Hart Trophy finalist for the seventh time in his career. He was also elected team-MVP. Crosby was selected to the NHL All-Decade First Team in January 2020. The Penguins finished fifth in the Eastern Conference in the\\xa0COVID-19-shortened 2019–20 season, facing the 12th-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference qualifying round.

The team clinched a playoff berth for the 15th consecutive season under Crosby's captaincy, the longest active postseason streak among all teams in the North American professional sports leagues. However, the Penguins were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Islanders for the second time in three seasons.\\n\\nOn February 15, 2022, Crosby scored his 500th career goal on a power play against the Philadelphia Flyers, becoming the 46th player to score that many goals in NHL history, the 18th to have scored them all for a single team, and the second Penguin to reach that plateau (Lemieux was first).\\n\\nInternational play\\n\\nJunior\\nCrosby debuted internationally for Canada at the 2003 U-18 Junior World Cup in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships in Helsinki, he then became the youngest player to score a goal in the history of the tournament at 16\\xa0years, 4\\xa0months, and 21\\xa0days when he scored against Switzerland in a 7–2 win. This record would last until the 2012 World Juniors when Aleksander Barkov of Finland scored a goal aged 16\\xa0years, 4\\xa0months. Crosby finished the tournament with two goals and three assists in six games, helping Canada to a silver medal finish. The following year, he returned for Canada at the 2005 World Junior Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He improved to six goals and three assists as Canada earned gold. Crosby stated the following year that his most memorable hockey moment was winning his World Junior gold medal.\\n\\nMen's\\nAfter completing his rookie season with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Crosby competed in the 2006 IIHF World Championship as an alternate captain for Canada. Scoring a tournament-best eight goals and eight assists in nine games, he became the youngest player ever to win a World Championship scoring title.

Crosby was named the tournament's top forward and to the competition's all-star team.\", 'After omitted from Canada\\'s Olympic team in 2006, Crosby was named to the Canadian roster on December 30, 2009 as an alternate captain for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He scored the game-winning shootout goal for Canada in the second game of the preliminary round against Switzerland. After going pointless in the quarter- and semi-final against Russia and Slovakia respectively, Crosby scored the winning goal 7 minutes and 40 seconds into overtime against the United States in the gold medal game. The goal has later become known as the \"Golden Goal\" due to it being scored in the gold medal game. It is also regarded by some as \"Canada\\'s most iconic sports moment\".\\n\\nFollowing the Penguins\\' second-round elimination in the 2010 playoffs, Crosby declined an invitation to join Canada midway through the 2010 IIHF World Championship in Germany. Crosby was selected to represent Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was later named team captain. Canada won gold, with Crosby contributing one goal and two assists in six games. He scored his only goal in the final against Sweden, further establishing his reputation as \"a player who rises up in big games\". In 2015, Crosby captained Canada to its first World Championship title since 2007, with the team winning all 10 games and scoring 66 goals. Crosby, scoring four goals and seven assists in nine games, became the 26th member of the Triple Gold Club. He is the first member of the club to captain all three championship teams, and the first member to be a first overall NHL draft pick.', 'In 2016, Hockey Canada named Crosby captain for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey in Toronto. Crosby, who led the tournament in scoring with ten points, helped Team Canada win the championship, and was named the Most Valuable Player. He joined Bobby Orr and Wayne Gretzky as the only players to win the Conn Smythe, Hart Memorial Trophy and World Cup MVP. Team Canada head coach Mike Babcock described Crosby as a serial winner, saying, \"He\\'s that high-end competitor. He\\'s a good leader because he tries to do it right all the time. He demands a lot out of himself. In doing so, he demands a lot out of his teammates.\" In 2020, he was named to the IIHF All-Time Canadian Team and the Men\\'s All-Decade Team.\\n\\nOn October 3, 2021, Crosby was one of the first three players named to the men\\'s hockey roster for Canada\\'s team for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, alongside Connor McDavid and Alex Pietrangelo.  However, due to the NHL\\'s subsequent decision not to attend the Beijing Games as a result of the Omicron variant\\'s impacts on scheduling, Crosby was unable to compete. He said afterward that \"I\\'ve been fortunate enough to be part of two. I definitely feel for the guys who have missed numerous opportunities.\"\\n\\nPlayer profile\\n\\nStyle of play', 'Player profile\\n\\nStyle of play\\n\\nAs captain and first-line centre for Canada, Crosby played with different line mates in almost every game as the coaching staff struggled to find players capable of keeping pace with the superstar centre at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, and again at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Crosby\\'s fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash, was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, \"I think he\\'s a tough guy to keep up with. He\\'s so fast. The way he thinks about the game seems like it\\'s far beyond everyone else\\'s process. It\\'s the same thing in the last Olympics, keep shuffling around until you found something that fit.\" Team Canada\\'s assistant coach in Vancouver, Ken Hitchcock, recalled, \"Sid thinks at a level, when the other team has the puck, that\\'s above everyone else in the league [NHL]. His anticipation when the other team has the puck is so high, he knows where it\\'s going ahead of time. He can pick off passes, make you make errors. And then he also knows where people are located on the ice, so he can turn that turnover into a scoring chance.\"\\n\\nOther professional NHL players have particularly noted Crosby for his backhand shot. For example, in his column for The Players\\' Tribune, Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings praised Crosby for having \"the best backhand shot\" in the NHL. \"His blade is almost completely flat, which combined with his ridiculous forearm strength gives him the ability to go forehand to your five hole instantly or turn it over to the backhand and roof it (a lot of guys can\\'t do this with a flat blade).\"\\n\\nReputation', 'Reputation\\n\\nNoted for his on-ice vision, passing ability, leadership, work ethic and complete overall game, Crosby is considered to be one of the greatest players of all time. Bobby Orr named Crosby among the five best players in the history of NHL. Wayne Gretzky said of Crosby, \"He\\'s proven over and over that he\\'s the best player in the game today. And it seems like the more important the game, the more impact that he makes on a game.\" Gordie Howe was also impressed by Crosby, \"I met him and I\\'ve seen him play. Unless you put two guys on him, he\\'ll kill you in a game.\" In 2016, Mario Lemieux praised his protégé for his ability to play both sides of the puck: \"I think he\\'s more of a complete player. Defensively, I think he\\'s improved a lot over the last couple of years.\" In an article for The Washington Post, other players, teammates and coaches highlighted his work ethic and strive for greatness as a major factor to Crosby\\'s lasting success. \"While his natural ability – powerful skating, pistol-quick hands, uncommon feel – made him a phenom, his creative, distinct capacity for work has enabled him to stay atop the NHL.\" Current Pittsburgh head coach Mike Sullivan described Crosby as \"best 200-foot player in the game\" and the \"heartbeat\" of the Penguins.', 'On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Crosby was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. In that same year, Fox Sports ranked Crosby 15th on their \"21 greatest athletes of the 21st century (so far)\" list, and TSN named him the eighth-best NHL player of all-time. Four months before the 2022 Winter Olympics, Rob Rossi of The Athletic called him \"arguably North America\\'s most dominant team-sport Winter Olympian.\" In a survey conducted by Sportsnet in June 2017, Crosby was voted by Canadians to be the greatest athlete of the 21st century. A poll conducted by the NHLPA in 2018 of more than 500 players resulted in Crosby being voted the \"most difficult to play against, best role model, best team player, the player you\\'d want to win one game, and the player who would be a great coach upon retirement\". In 2018, Crosby was chosen as Nova Scotia\\'s \"Best athlete ever\" by the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame. In 2019, an anonymous survey conducted by The Athletic showed that Crosby was regarded the best all-around NHL player by his peers.\\n\\nConsidered a generational talent and a franchise player, drafting Crosby changed the fortunes of a struggling Pittsburgh Penguins. It helped secure funding for a new arena and ended speculation that the franchise would relocate to another city. In 2005–06, his presence helped Pittsburgh\\'s attendance increase by 33%. Crosby\\'s arrival also aided in reinvigorating and expanding the roots of hockey in the Pittsburgh area. Penguins CEO and president David Morehouse said, \"We were in last place, we were last in revenues, we were last in attendance, our TV ratings were minimal and we were in the oldest building in the NHL... We were able to draw attention to us as a franchise because of the drafting of Sidney Crosby and the subsequent success we had.\"', \"Jerseys\\nCrosby's number 87 Pittsburgh Penguins jersey was the top seller on the NHL's website from September 2005 to February 2008. It has continued to be among the top-selling jerseys since his rookie season. In January 2005, an Air Canada baggage handler in Montreal stole Crosby's red Canada jersey from the World Junior Hockey Championship. It was recovered later in a mailbox. His white jersey from the tournament was temporarily delisted from an auction while the red one was missing. It eventually sold for $22,100, which went to youth hockey charities and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief.\\n\\nLess than a year later, one of Crosby's game-worn sweaters disappeared. The jersey he wore in his first NHL game, played against the New Jersey Devils, disappeared from his father's luggage during a flight from Pittsburgh to Buffalo. The jersey was later found at the Pittsburgh International Airport between a piece of equipment and a stairwell. Crosby's jersey from his third NHL game was the highest-selling NHL jersey in an auction for Hurricane Katrina relief – it sold for $21,010. During an online auction held by the NHL and the NHL Players Association to benefit Hockey Fights Cancer, Crosby's game-worn jersey from the first period of the 2007 All-Star Game earned the most money. Crosby's sold for $47,520, more than eight times the next highest price—$5,681 for the jersey worn by Brendan Shanahan of the New York Rangers.\", 'Following Crosby\\'s Olympic gold medal victory with Canada in 2010, it was announced that his stick and glove were missing. It was initially suspected that they might have been stolen; Reebok Canada offered a reward of CAD$10,000 for their return, \"no questions asked\". On March 10, the items were found: Crosby\\'s stick had been placed in a shipment bound for the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in Saint Petersburg, Russia, (the shipment was intercepted in Toronto) and his glove was found in a hockey bag belonging to Olympic teammate and Boston Bruins\\' centre Patrice Bergeron, whose stall was beside Crosby\\'s in the locker room.\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nCrosby rarely discusses his personal life and avoids social media. Andy O\\'Brien, Crosby\\'s fitness trainer for over 15 years, has said: \"He [Crosby] wants to be one of the guys and doesn\\'t really seek to separate himself or get special treatment in any way... He takes a lot of enjoyment in the regular, simple things in life and having a normal, ordinary routine\". Greg Powers described Crosby as essentially the brother of Lemieux\\'s son Austin, as he lived with Lemieux\\'s family in Sewickley, Pennsylvania from 2005 until 2010. In the spring of 2010, Crosby purchased his own home in the same area. In June 2006, he bought his first house on Grand Lake in Halifax, Nova Scotia.', 'On May 29, 2010, it was announced that Crosby would sign the richest endorsement contract in NHL history with Reebok, expected to pay Crosby $1.4\\xa0million per year for five to seven years. In 2015, he signed a six-year endorsement contract with Adidas. Crosby also has endorsement deals with Bell, Tim Hortons, and Gatorade. Regarded as one of Canada\\'s \"legendary goal-scorers and storied leaders\", Crosby was featured in Canada Post\\'s NHL Great Canadian Forwards stamp collection, alongside Phil Esposito, Guy Lafleur, Darryl Sittler, Mark Messier, and Steve Yzerman. In 2016, he won an Emmy Award for his role in There\\'s No Place Like Home With Sidney Crosby. He also won for his participation in the Merci Sidney video that followed his return to Rimouski for his QMJHL jersey retirement ceremony.\\n\\nCrosby has a younger sister named Taylor who is a hockey goaltender. Like her brother, she went to high school at Shattuck-Saint Mary\\'s in Faribault, Minnesota to play with the school\\'s hockey program. In 2014, Taylor joined the Northeastern Huskies women\\'s ice hockey team as a freshman at Northeastern University in Boston. In 2015, she transferred to Minnesota\\'s St. Cloud State University and played with the St. Cloud State Huskies women\\'s ice hockey team through to graduation at the end of the 2017–18 school year.\\n\\nCrosby continues to be active in the community in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. He created the Sidney Crosby Foundation in 2009, an organization committed to helping charities benefiting children. In 2015, he started a hockey school in Cole Harbour.

Furthermore, work accomplishments are believed, in turn, to increases self-efficacy through a feedback loop tying subsequent performance to augmented self-efficacy beliefs.\\n\\nBackground to the construct \\n\\nSelf-efficacy has been widely established in the literature as a critical construct within Albert Bandura's social learning theory. It constitutes a judgment about one's ability to perform a particular behavior pattern. Self-efficacy expectations are considered the primary cognitive determinant of whether or not an individual will attempt a given behavior. Self-efficacy is known to have considerable potential explanatory power over such behaviors as: self-regulation, achievement strivings, academic persistence and success, coping, choice of career opportunities, and career competency. Perhaps its most noteworthy contribution is its empirical relationship to subsequent performance.\", 'Most efforts to measure self-efficacy have focused on a subject\\'s expectations about performing specific tasks or what is referred to as \"domain-specific\" or \"situation-specific\" efficacy beliefs.  However, researchers such as Sherer et al. and Chen, Gully, and Eden have validated general scales with the belief that individuals who have a history of varied and numerous experiences of success can be expected to have positive self-efficacy expectancies in a variety of situations.  Accordingly, these expectancies are thought to generalize to actions beyond any specific target behavior.  Noted to be a different construct than task-specific self-efficacy, though a possible predictor, general self-efficacy is thought to be a motivational state, whereas task-specific self-efficacy a motivational trait.  Though both share similar antecedents, general efficacy is thought to be more resistant to ephemeral influences and more tied to other self-evaluation constructs such as self-esteem or locus of control.\\n\\nWhile the debate on the value of a general self-efficacy construct goes on, there is also the question of whether there might be an intermediate zone between a general expectancy and a specific task domain. In particular, might there be value in defining one\\'s expectations about performance in a general context, such as at work or at school. When it comes to work, for example, there is interest in knowing what makes some workers more capable of adjusting to new work contexts than others.  Some administrators of work training and cooperative education programs have also asked what is in the \"black box\" of training that makes some trainees more successful than others.\\n\\nPrior experimentation', 'Prior experimentation\\n\\nThere has been reference to work self-efficacy in the literature through such studies as Woodruff and Cashman Bosscher and Smit Chen and Gully and Kirk and Brown.  However, the measure used for work-domain self-efficacy in these studies was not derived from any specific theoretical work trying to understand and outline specific dimensions attending to the work context.  Rather, these studies in each case chose items from Sherer et al.\\'s general self-efficacy scale presumed to apply to work.  In the Kirk and Brown study, noted above, the work-domain self-efficacy scale was culled to merely 11 items from the general scale, but the authors did not use theory to guide their selection; rather they eliminated items which did not load robustly on the general scale.  In examining the Scherer scale, although a few items refer specifically to work (\"If I can\\'t do a job the first time, I keep trying until I can\"), most do not (\"When I make plans, I am certain that I can make them work\").  It could be argued that any development of a work self-efficacy inventory should progress on the basis of an explicit selection of items that apply specifically within a work context.\\n\\nA published article from International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy describes a study constructed on the self-efficiency of adolescent, especially on high school teenagers, with previous work experience. The study showed that those with employment lasting for a firm duration than those with random pattern of employments has a stronger self-efficiency. In turn, the heightened self-efficiency increases the confidence level of young adults for the future anticipations of family lives, community participations, personal health and economic achievements.\\n\\nDevelopment', 'Development \\n\\nPerhaps the first suggestion to consider self-efficacy as a theoretical framework to explain how especially novices adjust to the workplace was by Fletcher, who argued that self-efficacy may help differentiate students making the transition from pupil to practitioner.  Specifically, Fletcher suggested that workplace experiences can increase self-efficacy through performance accomplishments, one source of efficacy information.  Successful experiences can result in a feedback loop where performance accomplishments lead to increased self-efficacy, which, in turn, enhances a person\\'s performance, further strengthening self-efficacy beliefs. \\n \\nNumerous research studies have refined and elaborated on the application of self-efficacy theory to career development and workplace learning. There was nevertheless the task of assembling its constituents.  Evidence from the value of cooperative education programs have long suggested that any persistent advantages accruing to participants in these programs are more tied to the non-technical than the technical skills they afford. By non-technical, work training administrators focus on the social skills or what is also referred to as the \"soft\" skills rather than the hard, subject-matter skills.  In turn, authors reference social skills as human relations aptitudes considered critical in interpersonal communication.  The soft skills focus as well on communication competencies, especially empathy and sensitivity, and competencies involving interacting with others, such as teamworking and giving and receiving feedback.', 'The self-efficacy and work performance literatures are helpful in distinguishing some of the other constituents necessary to develop a work self-efficacy scale.  We know, for example, that it is not sufficient to \"empower\" workers and expect improved work performance without considering individual differences that might be differentiated by self-efficacy and related constructs.  In particular, workers\\' learning orientation helps them facilitate achievement of goals that are important to them, evaluate their own competency, and enhance their self-efficacy. Further, efficacy can be augmented by the belief that one has personal control over his or her job situation, much of which emanates from an understanding and determination of one\\'s role expectations.   Self-efficacy is also shaped by how new workers become socialized into the organization or how, for example, they adjust to the politics of the new organization. Zellars et al. found that job-related self-efficacy contributed to the political skill necessary to cope with strain relationships inside an organization. Previous research has also found significant relationships between self-efficacy and ability to cope with pressure. Saks, for example, found that newcomers with high self-efficacy may be more self-sufficient and capable of coping and surviving entry experiences.  \\n\\nSelf-efficacy has been associated with active jobs, in particular, jobs which promote active vs. passive problem-solving. Self-efficacy has also been studied as a moderator of sensitivity and interpersonal communication especially among young people. Finally, self-efficacy on particular work tasks in teams has been linked to teamwork performance.\\n\\nThe work self-efficacy inventory (WS-Ei)', 'The work self-efficacy inventory (WS-Ei) \\n\\nThe work self-efficacy inventory was developed in the belief that there is benefit in assessing especially new or prospective workers\\' confidence in managing workplace experiences.  It was developed by Dr. Joe Raelin, the Knowles Chair of Practice-Oriented Education at Northeastern University to measure a range of behaviors and practices attending to one\\'s beliefs in his/her command of the social requirements necessary for success in the workplace.  Since efficacy is a malleable property, there are methods for employees to achieve relative success in their jobs within the workplace by increasing their confidence about performing a range of social behaviors.  This inventory allows workers to assess and develop their work self-efficacy along a number of distinct dimensions.\\n\\nThe WS-Ei\\'s theoretical underpinning is that individuals with higher work self-efficacy are more likely to look forward to, and to be successful in, workplace performance.  Furthermore, work accomplishments are believed, in turn, to increases self-efficacy through a feedback loop tying subsequent performance to augmented self-efficacy beliefs.   The WS-Ei features seven 5-point Likert-type scales in a response format ranging from \"Not at all Confident\" to \"Completely Confident\", and consists of 30 items organized into the following seven dimensions and an overall composite score:', \"Learning:  confidence in being able to learn productively on the job.\\n Problem-Solving:  confidence in solving problems in the workplace.\\n Pressure:  confidence in coping with stress as well as with time and schedule pressures.\\n  Role Expectations:  confidence in understanding and fulfilling one's role(s) assigned at work.\\n Teamwork: confidence in working well within a team environment.\\nSensitivity: confidence in demonstrating sensitivity to others in the workplace.\\n Work Politics: confidence in scoping out and managing organizational politics and traditions.\\n  General Work Self-Efficacy:  confidence in managing oneself well in the workplace.\\n\\nNorms for the WS-Ei have set the average score for each of the dimensions and the overall composite score at 3.8 with a standard deviation of .6.  The inventory has been submitted to both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and has consistently shown itself to be highly reliable (with Cronbach Alphas in the .80 range for both subscores and overall score) and to have strong convergent and discriminant validity.  It has been used in a variety of studies both in the United States and abroad, and has been linked to work performance as well as to a range of educational dimensions, such as support and retention, and to other facets of efficacy, such as academic and career.\", \"Moderating factors between self-efficacy and work performance \\n Task complexity: Task complexity is a strong moderator of the relationship between self-efficacy and performance. Over repeated task performance trials, the differences in the correlation of self-efficacy and performance between simple and complex tasks may decrease, or even disappear.\\n Task Strategies: Perceptions of higher self-efficacy may lead to the development of more effective strategies necessary for successful performance on the complex task. Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to develop poorer task strategies than those high on self efficacy.\\n Task focus: Analysis suggests that whether task performers develop effective task strategies on complex tasks also depend on the relationship between self efficacy and an individual self-orientation. Low self-efficacy tends to cause people to become more self-focused rather than task-diagnostic. This interferes with the optimal deployment of the cognitive resources necessary to develop and test complex task strategies. People with low self efficacy also focus on personal deficiencies and possible adverse task outcomes, rather than on sustained attention to complex task demands requisite for development of effective task strategies.\\n Skill acquisition: Learning is considered as another explanation of possible lagged effects between self-efficacy and performance for the different levels of task complexity. Self efficacy theory distinguishes between performance efficacy beliefs and beliefs in one's efficacy to acquire new competencies. Research shows that perceived learning efficacy is a good predictor of the acquisition of complex skills necessary for successful execution of complex tasks.\\n\\nForms of the WS-Ei\", \"Forms of the WS-Ei \\n\\nThe WS-Ei has two forms, self and other. \\n \\nThe self version is completed by the respondent on himself or herself.  There are 30 statements each based on the stem to reflect the respondent's confidence in his or her ability to perform a variety of workplace activities.  The survey typically takes no more than ten to fifteen minutes to complete.\\n\\nThe other-rated version (which can also be filled out by the self) is a single-item test.  Rather than a perceptual measure, it is a performance-based measure that can be used as a basis for professional and personal development and also as a tool for performance review based on 360-degree feedback.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n The Work Self-Efficacy Inventory\\n\\nPersonnel economics\", \"The Wright State Raiders are the athletics teams of Wright State University in Fairborn, Ohio.

The estate spans over 43 acres and is located in the providential rocky knoll in the volcanic hills of Coombsville which has a geologic history dating back 9 million years.\\n\\nThe Wines \\nCurrently the Vineyard produces two wines from the Sauvignon Blanc grapes planted on the lower Eastern slopes where the temperature is a few degrees cooler and suited for this varietal and a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the western slopes which are more gradual and get maximum sun throughout the day. The first vintage of Sauvignon Blanc was 2017 and the first vintage of the Cabernet Sauvignon was 2015. Both varietals  have received great reviews from the critics and have been rated very high. In 2018 the team decided to plant some more grape varieties and Merlot and Malbec were planted. The 2020 vintage will be produced using some more varietals.\\n\\nThe Team', 'The Team \\n\\nCelia Welch is recognized as one of the world’s finest winemakers. She grew up in Oregon and first learned about wine from her father, a home winemaker and collector. She graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Enology and honed her skills in the Pacific Northwest, New Zealand and Australia before settling in Napa Valley. Rewa Vineyards represents a significant project from perhaps the best terroir in the budding Coombsville AVA.\\n \\nMike Wolf is a viticulturist who was raised just outside New York City and graduated from Alfred University with a Bachelor’s Degree in history.

Traditionally, they might be given to prove membership when challenged and to enhance morale.  They are also collected by service members and law enforcement personnel. Historically, challenge coins were presented by unit commanders in recognition of special achievement by a member of the unit.  They could also be exchanged in recognition of visits to an organization.\\n\\nModern day challenge coins may feature popular culture attributes or organizational values. Modern challenge coins are made in a variety of sizes and are often made using popular culture references, including superheroes and other well known characters in a way that creates a parody.\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThere are several stories detailing the origins of the challenge coin. Many originate in popular culture based on current events.\\n\\nThe Roman Empire rewarded soldiers by presenting them with coins to recognize their achievements.\\n\\nChallenge coins were also known as \"Portrait Medals\" during the Renaissance, and were often used to commemorate specific events involving royalty, nobility, or other types of well-to-do individuals.  The medals would be given as gifts or awards, and people also exchanged them with friends and associates.  The most common format was for one side to depict the patron while the other showed something that represented that individual\\'s family, house, lineage, and/or seal.', \"The first instance of using a coin as a response to an actual challenge may come from the 17th century religious wars in France. Following King Louis XIV's 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, French Protestants began to suffer persecution by the state for their illegal religion. Many Protestants fled France to find religious freedom elsewhere. Among those who chose to remain in France were some from a Protestant group known as Huguenots who were forced to conduct their religious services in secret. In order to avoid infiltration by state spies the Huguenots began to carry their méreau communion coin. When challenged while trying to gain entry to Protestant church services the Huguenot would produce his méreau coin as a token to show allegiance with the Protestant Church and be admitted entry.\\n\\nAccording to the most common story, challenge coins originated during World War I. Before the entry of the United States into the war in 1917 American volunteers from all parts of the country filled the newly formed flying squadrons. Some were wealthy scions attending colleges such as Yale and Harvard who quit in mid-term to join the war.\", \"In one squadron, a wealthy lieutenant ordered medallions struck in solid bronze and presented them to his unit. One young pilot placed the medallion in a small leather pouch that he wore about his neck. Shortly after acquiring the medallion, the pilot's aircraft was severely damaged by ground fire. He was forced to land behind enemy lines and was immediately captured by a German patrol. In order to discourage his escape, the Germans took all of his personal identification except for the small leather pouch around his neck. In the meantime, he was taken to a small French town near the front. Taking advantage of a bombardment that night, he escaped. However, he was without personal identification. He succeeded in avoiding German patrols by donning civilian attire and reached the front lines. With great difficulty, he crossed no-man's land. Eventually, he stumbled onto a French outpost. Saboteurs had plagued the French in the sector. They sometimes masqueraded as civilians and wore civilian clothes. Not recognizing the young pilot's American accent, the French thought him to be a saboteur and made ready to execute him. He had no identification to prove his allegiance, but he did have his leather pouch containing the medallion. He showed the medallion to his would-be executioners and one of his French captors recognized the squadron insignia on the medallion. They delayed his execution long enough for him to confirm his identity. Instead of shooting him they gave him a bottle of wine.\", 'Back at his squadron, it became tradition to ensure that all members carried their medallion or coin at all times. This was accomplished through challenge in the following manner: a challenger would ask to see the medallion, if the challenged could not produce a medallion, they were required to buy a drink of choice for the member who challenged them. If the challenged member produced a medallion, then the challenging member was required to pay for the drink. This tradition continued throughout the war and for many years after the war while surviving members of the squadron were still alive.\\n\\nAccording to another story, challenge coins date back to World War II and were first used by Office of Strategic Service personnel who were deployed in Nazi held France. Similarly, Jim Harrington proposed a Jolly sixpence club amongst the junior officers of the 107th Infantry.  The coins were simply a local coin used as a \"bona fides\" during a personal meeting to help verify a person\\'s identity. There would be specific aspects such as type of coin, date of the coin, etc. that were examined by each party. This helped prevent infiltration into the meeting by a spy who would have to have advance knowledge of the meeting time and place as well as what coin was to be presented, amongst other signals, as bona fides.', 'While a number of legends place the advent of challenge coins in the post-Korean Conflict era (some as late as the Vietnam War), or even later, Colonel William \"Buffalo Bill\" Quinn had coins made for those who served in his 17th Infantry Regiment during 1950 to 1958. The 17th Infantry Regiment \"Buffalo\" coin is the oldest challenge coin known in existence. On one side of the coin is a picture of a buffalo with the date 1812, which signified the year the unit was formed. On the other side was the 17th Infantry patch with the dates 1950 – 1958 and the word Korea to signify the tour. The cross and fort icon represent the units heritage which started in Cuba during the civil war. This coin is recognized as one of the oldest and most valuable challenge coins in circulation. Very few remain available and most are thought to be in private collections.\\n\\nColonel Verne Green, commander of the 10th Special Forces Group-A, embraced the idea.  He had a special coin struck with the unit\\'s badge and motto in 1969.  Until the 1980s, his unit was the only unit with an active challenge coin tradition.\\n\\nThere is another story about an American soldier scheduled to rendezvous with Philippine guerrillas during WWII.  As the story goes, he carried a Philippine solid silver coin that was stamped on one side with the unit insignia. The coin was used to verify, to the guerrillas, that the soldier was their valid contact for the mission against the Japanese.', \"The challenge coin tradition has spread to other military units, in all branches of service, and even to non-military organizations as well as the United States Congress, which produces challenge coins for members of Congress to give to constituents. Today, challenge coins are given to members upon joining an organization, as an award to improve morale, and sold to commemorate special occasions or as fundraisers. In the Air Force, military training instructors award an airman's coin to new enlisted personnel upon completion of their United States Air Force Basic Military Training and to new officers upon completion of the Air Force Officer Training School.\\n\\nU.S. presidents\\n\\nChallenge coins issued by presidents date back to the late 1990s. Separately, the White House Communication Agency (WHCA) has issued challenge coins for foreign heads and military during Presidential visits. In May 2018, controversy arose when WHCA released a coin featuring President Donald Trump and North Korean head Kim Jong-un ahead of peace talks scheduled for June 2018 in Singapore.\\n\\nPresident Bill Clinton displayed several racks of challenge coins, which had been given to him by U.S. service members, on the credenza behind his Oval Office desks. These coins are currently on display at the Clinton Library. The challenge coins appear in the background of his official portrait, now hanging in the White House.\\n\\nPresident George W. Bush received a challenge coin from a Marine combat patrol unit during his short but unexpected visit to Al Asad Airbase in Anbar province, Iraq, 3 September 2007.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama, in addition to handing challenge coins to U.S. service members, would leave coins on the memorial graves of dead soldiers.\", 'President Barack Obama, in addition to handing challenge coins to U.S. service members, would leave coins on the memorial graves of dead soldiers.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump\\'s coin broke with tradition, omitting the presidential seal, the motto \"E pluribus unum\" and the thirteen arrows representing the thirteen original states. His campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\" appears on both sides. It features a banner at the bottom, which also serves as a base allowing the coin to stand upright.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden\\'s coin depicts his home state of Delaware and \"261st\" for the 261st Theater Tactical Signal Brigade of the Delaware Army National Guard, his late son Beau Biden\\'s unit.\\n\\nChallenging\\n\\nThe tradition of a challenge is the most common way to ensure that members are carrying their unit\\'s coin. The rules of a challenge are not always formalized for a unit, and may vary between organizations. The challenge only applies to those members that have been given a coin formally by their unit. This may lead to some controversy when challenges are initiated between members of different organizations and is not recommended. The tradition of the coin challenge is meant to be a source of morale in a unit, and forcing the challenge can cause a reverse effect.  The act of challenging is called a \"coin check\" and is usually loudly announced.\\n\\nThe challenge, which can be made at any time, begins with the challenger drawing his/her coin, and slapping or placing the coin on the table or bar. In noisy environments, continuously rapping the challenge coin on a surface may initiate the challenge. (Accidentally dropping a challenge coin is considered to be a deliberate challenge to all present.) Everyone being challenged must immediately produce the coin for their organization and anyone failing to do so must buy a round of drinks for the challenger and everyone else who has their challenge coin. However, should everyone challenged be able to produce their coin, the challenger must buy a round of drinks for the group.', 'While most holders of challenge coins usually carry them in their pockets or in some other readily accessible place on their persons, most versions of the rules permit a challenged person \"a step and a reach\" or if an individual has an extra coin to pass it off to the person closest to them.  Coins on belt buckles or key chains are not acceptable for meeting a challenge.  However, a coin worn around the neck is acceptable for meeting a coin challenge.\\n\\nVariants of the rules include, but are not limited to, the following: If someone is able to steal a challenge coin, everyone in the group must buy a drink for that person. During a challenge, everyone in the group must buy a drink for the holder of the highest-ranking coin.\\n\\nA coin\\'s rank is determined by the rank of the giver of the challenge coin. For example, a coin presented by an Admiral would outrank a coin presented by a Vice Admiral, while both would outrank a coin presented by a Captain. Traditionally, the presentation of a coin is passed during a handshake. Some units provide strict time limits to respond to a challenge. Also coins are ranked in level of difficulty in attaining them. An Infantryman coin would outrank a logistical coin. A Ranger coin would outrank an Infantryman coin.\\n\\nTraditionally, rules of a challenge include a prohibition against defacing the coin, especially if it makes it easier to carry at all times. If the challenge coin is attached to a belt buckle or key ring, or has had a hole drilled in it to attach to a lanyard, it no longer qualifies as a challenge coin.\\n\\nAppearance\\nThere are many finishes available—from a simple pewter to 24K gold.  While there are only a few base metals, the patina (finish) can range from gold, silver, or nickel to brass, copper, or bronze—plus the antiqued variations. Soft or hard enamel or a printed inset with an epoxy coating may add color (the epoxies are often more resilient and scratch resistant than the metal surfaces).', 'Cost\\nChallenge coins are moderately inexpensive to design and produce. There are two basic processes by which to manufacture: zinc-alloy castings or die struck bronze.\\n\\nZinc alloy castings offer the advantage of low cost.  Zinc casting also allows more flexibility in design like cutouts found on spinner coins or bottle opener coins. While a die struck bronze or brass coin is more expensive, the result renders a far superior product (numismatic quality).\\n\\n, coins manufactured in China and South Korea typically cost between US$2.50 to US$7.00 per coin, depending on production process and complexity of design, laser engraving, enamels, voids, etc. The dies must be sculpted by an artist and can range in cost from US$50 to US$300, depending on complexity.  The cost of domestic manufacture can be many times this amount.\\n\\nIn order to be competitive, most North American companies offering challenge coins rely on having the product manufactured offshore.  Many challenge coins are fabricated in South Korea, as the connection to the US military bases there is strong, and costs are cheaper than those made in the US.\\n\\nUses\\n\\nBesides using coins for challenging, they are also used as rewards or awards for outstanding service or performance of duty. As such, they are used as a tool to build morale. Military officials occasionally give them to non-military personnel for outstanding service or rewards, like the case of student athletes at Northeastern University.\\n\\nIn the context as they are used by the modern U.S. military, the tradition probably began among special forces units during the Vietnam War.  The tradition spread through the Airborne community, and by the early 1980s also into the 75th Ranger Regiment.  As officers were reassigned as their careers progressed, they carried with them the tradition of awarding a unit coin for acts that were worthy of recognition but yet lacked enough merit to submit the soldiers act for an official medal.', 'One widely known challenge coin in the United States Air Force  was the \"Bull Dog\" challenge coin that was exclusive to B-52 enlisted tail gunners.  Since the B-52 gunner position was phased out in 1991, this famous challenge coin has become rarer.\\n\\nThis coin was presented to gunners upon graduation from their Air Force technical training and their entry into the \"Gunners Association\". In the earlier days of bombers, a bean or a nugget was used. The coin represents the attributes of strength and courage as reflected in the Bulldog, the gunner\\'s official mascot. The coin was also given to certain \"honorary gunners\", usually commanders and leaders who portrayed the spirit of the bulldog.\\n\\nSome collectors buy them for their numismatic value.\\n\\nCoins given as awards for accomplishments are normally given to the recipient during a handshake, passing from the right hand of the giver to the right hand of the awardee. It is also normal for the giver to offer a brief explanation of the reason for awarding the coin.\\n\\nOutside the military\\nChallenge coins are also exchanged outside the military. NASCAR, the NFL, cadets of the Civil Air Patrol, Eagle Scouts and World Series of Poker all have their own challenge coins. They are also becoming popular with police departments, fire departments and fraternal organizations. In 2007, the Utah Symphony and Opera gave challenge coins to all of its staff and musicians, making it the first symphony organization in America to do so.

A key component to loss prevention is assessing the potential threats to the successful achievement of the goal. This must include the potential opportunities that further the object (why take the risk unless there's an upside?) Balance probability and impact determine and implement measures to minimize or eliminate those threats.\\n\\nSecurity risk management\\nThe management of security risks applies the principles of risk management to the management of security threats. It consists of identifying threats (or risk causes), assessing the effectiveness of existing controls to face those threats, determining the risks' consequence(s), prioritizing the risks by rating the likelihood and impact, classifying the type of risk, and selecting an appropriate risk option or risk response. In 2016, a universal standard for managing risks was developed in The Netherlands. In 2017, it was updated and named: Universal Security Management Systems Standard 2017.\\n\\nTypes of risks\\n\\nExternal\\n Strategic: Competition and customer demand.\\n Operational: Regulations, suppliers, and contract.\\n Financial: FX and credit.\\n Hazard: Natural disasters, cyber, and external criminal acts.\\n Compliance: New regulatory or legal requirements are introduced, or existing ones are changed, exposing the organization to a non-compliance risk if measures are not taken to ensure compliance.\", \"Internal\\n Strategic: R&D.\\n Operational: Systems and processes (H&R, Payroll).\\n Financial: Liquidity and cash flow.\\n Hazard: Safety and security; employees and equipment.\\n Compliance: Concrete or potential changes in an organization's systems, processes, suppliers, etc. may create exposure to a legal or regulatory non-compliance.\\n\\nRisk options\\n\\nRisk avoidance\\nThe first choice to be considered is the possibility of eliminating the existence of criminal opportunity or avoiding the creation of such an opportunity. When additional considerations or factors are not created as a result of this action that would create a greater risk. For example, removing all the cash flow from a retail outlet would eliminate the opportunity for stealing the money, but it would also eliminate the ability to conduct business.\\n\\nRisk reduction\\nWhen avoiding or eliminating the criminal opportunity conflicts with the ability to conduct business, the next step is reducing the opportunity of potential loss to the lowest level consistent with the function of the business. In the example above, the application of risk reduction might result in the business keeping only enough cash on hand for one day's operation.\\n\\nRisk spreading\\nAssets that remain exposed after the application of reduction and avoidance are the subjects of risk spreading. This is the concept that limits loss or potential losses by exposing the perpetrator to the probability of detection and apprehension prior to the consummation of the crime through the application of perimeter lighting, barred windows, and intrusion detection systems. The idea is to reduce the time available for thieves to steal assets and escape without apprehension.\\n\\nRisk transfer\\nThe two primary methods of accomplishing risk transfer is to ensure the assets or raise prices to cover the loss in the event of a criminal act. Generally speaking, when the first three steps have been properly applied, the cost of transferring risks is much lower.\", 'Risk acceptance\\nAll of the remaining risks must simply be assumed by the business as a part of doing business. Included with these accepted losses are deductibles, which have been made as part of the insurance coverage.\\n\\nSecurity policy implementations\\n\\nIntrusion detection\\n Alarm device.\\n\\nAccess control\\n Locks, simple or sophisticated, such as biometric authentication and keycard locks.\\n\\nPhysical security\\n Environmental elements (ex.

He served as the 58th Governor of Massachusetts and was its youngest-ever Attorney General.\\nAmong his notable accomplishments was the construction of Boston’s circumferential highway Route 128, then called \"Dever’s Folley,\" which was later expanded to Interstate 95, one of the most used national highways.\\n\\nEarly life\\nPaul Dever was born in Boston, Massachusetts to two Irish immigrants, Joseph and Anna MacAlevy Dever.  His father died when he was eight, and he took odd jobs as a youth to help the family make ends meet.  He attended Boston public schools, including Boston Latin School.  He attended Northeastern University for a time, but then transferred to Boston University, from whose law school he graduated with an LL.B. in 1926 with high honors.  He was admitted to the bar, and joined the practice of Harvey Boutwell, a blind attorney whose need to have papers read aloud furthered Dever\\'s oratorical skills.\\n\\nHe served as the grand knight of the Mt. Pleasant Council of the Knights of Columbus. He was also the godfather to one of State Deputy Thomas J. Spring\\'s children. He appointed Spring to a judgeship in Roxbury District Court.\\n\\nEarly political career\\n\\nDever was long interested in politics, having observed his uncle John, a leading figure in Massachusetts Democratic Party politics.  He served for some time as an aide to Senator David I. Walsh, one of the state\\'s most prominent Democratic politicians.   Dever was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 3rd Middlesex district in 1928, and served from 1929 to 1935 in a district representing Cambridge that had historically been Republican.', \"In 1934 Dever was elected Attorney General, and was at age 31 the youngest to hold that office.  Among his claimed successes were a 95% conviction rate, and the closure of a significant number of lenders engaging in usurious lending practices.  He also identified under- or mis-utilized trust funds, including one which was eventually used for construction of the Hatch Shell on Boston's Charles River Esplanade.  In 1940, he challenged the popular incumbent Governor Leverett Saltonstall for his seat, losing by a margin of 0.3%.\\n\\nWorld War II\\nIn 1942, Dever enlisted in the United States Navy for World War II.  He was subsequently commissioned a lieutenant commander, and served in the North Atlantic, European and African Sectors until his discharge at the end of the war in 1945.  Assignments included command of the Marine Corps contingent at Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the delivery of election ballots to military posts.  After the war, he continued to serve in the military reserve, and was eventually promoted to commander.\\n\\nGovernor of Massachusetts\\n\\nDever lost the 1946 race for lieutenant governor, but two years later he defeated incumbent governor Robert F. Bradford in a Democratic landslide, which saw that party gain complete control of the state for the first time in the 20th century.  He was the state's 58th governor, and won election to a second term in  1950, defeating the Republican candidate, former Lieutenant Governor Arthur W. Coolidge.\\n\\nDuring his tenure, Dever increased state aid to schools and issued an executive order to extend higher education benefits to Korean War veterans. Among his chief concerns were civil defense and resisting domestic communism.  He supported legislation requiring school teachers to take loyalty oaths, and he advocated increasing old age and workers compensation insurance. He also introduced a graduated income tax, and introduced measures to improve the care and education of the state's mentally handicapped.\", \"A major statewide transportation infrastructure initiative, developed by Governor Bradford, was passed during his term.  Under this plan, the state constructed Massachusetts Route 128, the Central Artery, and Storrow Drive.  The first bond issue for this work was passed early in his term; it had previously been rejected by the Democratic legislature in Bradford's tenure.  This and other major spending initiatives greatly exceeded the amount raised by new tax levies, and marked the start of an extended period of deficit spending by the state.  In Dever's second term, transportation spending was further expanded, and he established the Massachusetts Turnpike Commission, which funded construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike through bonds paid off by tolls.\\n\\nAnother major initiative undertaken during Dever's period in office was a significant expansion of the state's facilities for the mentally handicapped, which had suffered for many years from overcrowding and understaffing.  Among the facilities built was the Myles Standish State School for the Mentally Retarded in Taunton, which was renamed the Paul A. Dever State School in his honor after his death.\\n\\nIn 1952, Dever made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Dever was also the keynote speaker at the 1952 Democratic National Convention; his speech, one of the first such speeches to be televised, made the portly Dever look bad.  Also that year, the Dever administration came under fire when the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations found that pensions for members and former members of the state legislature had been increased.  One of those eligible was former Mayor of Boston and Governor James Michael Curley, a convicted felon.  Dever gave in to pressure groups, calling a special session of the legislature that repealed the bill.\", \"Dever had built a strong political machine in Massachusetts, and was widely considered a potential candidate for the United States Senate in 1952, which was also sought by John F. Kennedy.  After informing Kennedy that he was interested in running again for governor, the two established a joint campaign committee.  Kennedy maintained a distance from Dever and his campaign, and was able to capture the Senate seat in the election, which was otherwise a major victory for Republicans.  Republican Christian Herter defeated Dever in a narrow win, assisted by the long coattails of Presidential winner Dwight David Eisenhower, and discontent among the state's ethnic Democrats for Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee.  After Dever's death, associates of his alleged that the publisher of the Boston Post pressured Dever to arrange a loan in exchange for the newspaper's endorsement.\\n\\nDeath and burial\\nAfter leaving office Dever returned to practicing law.  He attempted to remain active in politics, supporting Stevenson in the 1956 presidential race, even though most state party leaders did not believe Stevenson's chances against Eisenhower were any better than they had been in 1952.\\n\\nDever was a lifelong bachelor, who lived for many years in Cambridge with his sister Marie.  She served as his First Lady during his tenure as governor.  He suffered from heart disease in his later years, and died of a heart attack on April 11, 1958.  He was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery in the West Roxbury section of Boston.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nSources\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\", 'Notes\\n\\nSources\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n\\n1903 births\\n1958 deaths\\nUnited States Navy personnel of World War II\\nBoston University School of Law alumni\\nBurials in Massachusetts\\nGovernors of Massachusetts\\nMassachusetts Attorneys General\\nMassachusetts Democrats\\nMembers of the Massachusetts House of Representatives\\nPoliticians from Boston\\nUnited States Navy officers\\nCandidates in the 1952 United States presidential election\\nDemocratic Party state governors of the United States\\n20th-century American politicians', 'Mountain Lakes High School is a four-year comprehensive public high school that serves students in ninth through twelfth grade from Mountain Lakes, in Morris County, New Jersey, United States, operating as the lone secondary school of the Mountain Lakes Schools.

Her father, Nicolo Martines, grew up there and for a time pursued a career as a soldier. He later changed careers, serving in Vienna as Maestro di Camera (major-domo) at the papal nuncio; that is, the Pope\\'s embassy to the Austrian Empire. For service to the Empire, Marianna\\'s brothers in 1774 acquired a patent of nobility, hence the \"von\" in the family surname.\\n\\nIn his youth in Italy, Nicolo had befriended the poet Pietro Trapassi, who wrote under the name Metastasio. The latter had risen in eminence, to the point that in 1730 he was called to Vienna to serve as the Poet Laureate of the Empire. Metastasio resided with the Martines family for the entire rest of his life (from about 1734 to 1782). His presence would prove crucial to Marianne\\'s career.\\n\\nThe Martines family lived in rooms in a large building on the  in Vienna, \"a stately building still standing in the Kohlmarkt\". As was common in the days before elevators, the floors of the building corresponded to the social class of the inhabitants. On the lowest floor were the rooms of the dowager princess of the wealthy Esterházy family. The Martines family were on the third floor. Another resident of the middle floors was Nicola Porpora, a well-known Italian singing teacher and composer. At the very top, in a cold and leaky attic room, lived a struggling young composer, Joseph Haydn, who was trying to make his way as a freelance musician.  The lives of all of these people ultimately came to be connected, in part through Marianna Martines.\\n\\nShe was born into this home in 1744. Though baptized Anna Catherina, she chose to go by the name Marianna.', 'She was born into this home in 1744. Though baptized Anna Catherina, she chose to go by the name Marianna.\\n\\nMetastasio, the family friend, made it a practice to help out with the raising and careers of the Martines children; for instance, at one point he helped Giuseppe obtain an important job as custodian of the Imperial Library. In the case of Marianna, he noticed her precocious talents early, and thus came to oversee her education, musical and otherwise.\\n\\nHe first arranged for her to take keyboard lessons from Haydn, whom Metastasio had met as a result of their living in the same building. Then, at age ten, Marianna began singing lessons with Porpora, who had also met Haydn and taken him on as his assistant; Haydn played the harpsichord while Porpora taught Marianne.\\n\\nSoon after Marianna began her music lessons she demonstrated a talent for composition, so she began still further lessons with Johann Adolph Hasse and the Imperial court composer Giuseppe Bonno.\\n\\nMetastasio also saw to it that Marianna received a thorough general education, which far surpassed what was considered standard for women of her social class at that time. She was a native speaker of both Italian and German, and in an autobiographical letter to Padre Martini indicated that she had good command of French. The musicologist Charles Burney, visiting Vienna, found that she also could speak English.\\n\\nCareer as performer and composer\\n\\nAlready as a child Martines was good enough to perform before the Imperial court, where according to the Helene Wessely, she \"attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing.\" The adult Marianna was frequently asked to perform before the Empress Maria Theresa.', 'A number of the works that Martines composed are set for solo voice, and her biographers (Godt, Wessely) conjecture that the first singer of these works was their composer.  If so, they constitute further evidence for her ability, as the music shows a \"predilection for coloratura passages, leaps over wide intervals and trills indicat[ing] that she herself must have been an excellent singer.\" (Wessely).\\n\\nMartines wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts.  These texts are, naturally enough, the work of her mentor Metastasio.\\n\\nSurviving compositions include four masses, six motets, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early Classical period in Vienna.  Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of C.P.E. Bach.  Martines\\'s compositions were well regarded in her time, and some scholars have suggested that Mozart modeled his 1768 Mass, V. 139, after the \"Christe\" of Martines\\'s Mass No. 1 in D major.  The Michaelerkirche (St. Michael\\'s Church, next door to the Martines home), saw a performance of her third mass in 1761.  Her fourth mass was completed in 1765.\\n\\nLater life\\n\\nMartines\\'s name and music were known throughout Europe, and she was admitted to the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna in 1773.\\n\\nHer Italian oratorio Isacco figura del redentore was premiered by massive forces in concerts (17 and 19 March 1782) of the Tonkünstler-Societät, a long-standing series that also performed large-scale works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Handel. The vocal soloists included Caterina Cavalieri and Ludwig Fischer.', \"Martines and her sister, neither of whom ever married, looked after their family friend Metastasio until his death in 1782. Metastasio left his estate to the Martines family; Marianna received 20,000 florins, Metastasio's harpsichord, and his music library.  Marianna and her sister hosted musical soirees at their home.  These weekly musical events attracted many distinguished guests, including Haydn and Irish tenor Michael Kelly. Mozart also was a frequent guest at the soirees and composed four-hand piano sonatas to perform with Marianne.\\n\\nThough she was an active and highly accomplished performer and composer she never sought an appointed position; it would have been unacceptable for a woman in her social class to seek such employment.\\n\\nHer last known public appearance was on 23 March 1808, attending a performance of Haydn's oratorio Die Schöpfung conducted by Salieri, in tribute to the composer.  She died on 13 December 1812 and was buried in St. Marx's Cemetery.\\n\\nList of works\\n\\n2 oratorios; 4 masses; 6 motets; psalm cantatas; secular cantatas; 3 keyboard sonatas, 3 keyboard concertos; and 1 symphony.\\n\\nSeveral of her pieces have been published in recent years.  The three keyboard sonatas (in E Major, G Major and A Major) are available through Hildegard Publishing.  Many works are also available through Furore-Verlag, a German publisher that specializes in works by women composers.  They offer many first publications, including: the Keyboard Concerto in A; Dixit Dominus for Soli, Choir and Orchestra; In Exitu Israel de Agypto, Psalm for Soli, Choir and Orchestra; Laudate Pueri Dominum, Psalm 112, for SATB choir and orchestra; the Fourth Mass.\", 'Discography\\nMarianna Martines: Psalm Cantatas.

      "Kenneth (Ken) Ryder was born on April 30, 1924 in Brockton, MA to Russell Gilmore Ryder and Etta Carr Ryder.  Russell Ryder (b. Sept. 2, 1892– d. Jan. 25, 1965) was a veteran of World War I, serving in the 312th Field Signal Battalion as a signal officer in France during the war.  Russell had learned the telegraph trade from his father and uncles who were all telegraph officers. For many years, Russell was a payroll officer for the C.S. Pierce Shoe Company, in Brockton, MA. During World War II, Russell Ryder put his telegraph skills to work again and was employed by the Submarine Signal Company of Boston helping with the war effort.  Russell married Etta Coffin Carr (Dec. 19, 1888 – May 11, 1986) on July 19, 1921.  Etta grew up in Brockton, MA and graduated from Brockton High School in 1904.  Etta and Russell had one child, Kenneth, in 1924. \n",

      "Ken Ryder was a good student throughout his early years, excelling in history and public speaking. His public speaking ability was something that was honed as a part of the debate team and this was a skill that was admired throughout his lifetime. Ryder graduated from Brockton High School in 1940, giving the graduation address, and was named an Augustus Howe Buck Fellow, which included a full scholarship to Boston University.  Ryder became the first in his family to attend college. (In later years his father received a law degree by correspondence, and Russell had hoped that Ken would go on to become a lawyer as well).  Ryder once said, “My father thought law was the ideal profession, and it was there I set my sights.\" 2039\n"
